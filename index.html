four years since the 2nd edition of </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">Starting
Strength</span></span></span><span> was written. The Aasgaard Company
has changed personnel, I have met lots of people who have taught me many
things, and we have had enormous success with what I thought was going
to be a book ignored by the industry, academe, and the exercising
public. I was right about the fitness industry and the folks with
tenured positions, but I was wrong about you. Since 2007 we have taught
several thousand people how to do these five lifts in our weekend
seminars, and the 2nd edition has sold more than 80,000 copies, making
it one of the best-selling books about weight training in publishing
history. Thanks.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Now that we’ve learned some things from
you guys – the ones we’ve been busy teaching for four years – the
previous material in the 2nd edition is screaming for an update. Some of
it is stale, incomplete, or just plain wrong, and it can’t just lay
there like a bureaucrat, badly needing something useful to do but making
money anyway. This effort is not just the culmination of a
top-to-bottom, year-long rewrite. It is the product of an intensive
four-year testing program with many of you serving as the experimental
population, one which has improved the teaching method for the five
lifts, with an extra one thrown in.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>It has also been a four-year school for
me, as I have tried to find better ways to explain what I know to be
true in terms that are understandable, logical, and, most importantly,
correct. Much of this material is not in print anywhere else; hopefully,
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">that</span></span></span><span> doesn’t make it wrong.
But you’re pretty bright, so you can decide for
yourself.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The book needed a new look, too. Our
hope is that you enjoy the illustrations by Jason Kelly, in a different
style than usually found in a fat messy textbook, and that you
appreciate Stef’s Herculean efforts to make this a better-looking
example of the bookmaker’s art than the previous
edition.</span></span></p>

Why and How</span></span></span></p>

<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span><span class="calibre12">Physical
strength is the most important thing in life. This is true whether we
want it to be or not. As humanity has developed throughout history,
physical strength has become less critical to our daily existence, but
no less important to our lives. Our strength, more than any other thing
we possess, still determines the quality and the quantity of our time
here in these bodies. Whereas previously our physical strength
determined how much food we ate and how warm and dry we stayed, it now
merely determines how well we function in these new surroundings we have
crafted for ourselves as our culture has accumulated. But we are still
animals – our physical existence is, in the final analysis, the only one
that actually matters. A weak man is not as happy as that same man would
be if he were strong. This reality is offensive to some people who would
like the intellectual or spiritual to take precedence. It is instructive
to see what happens to these very people as their squat strength goes
up.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span><span class="calibre12">As the nature of
our culture has changed, our relationship with physical activity has
changed along with it. We previously were physically strong as a
function of our continued existence in a simple physical world. We were
adapted to this existence well, since we had no other choice. Those
whose strength was adequate to the task of staying alive continued doing
so. This shaped our basic physiology, and that of all our vertebrate
associates on the bushy little tree of life. It remains with us today.
The relatively recent innovation known as the Division of Labor is not
so remote that our genetic composition has had time to adapt again.
Since most of us now have been freed from the necessity of personally
obtaining our subsistence, physical activity is regarded as optional.
Indeed it is, from the standpoint of immediate necessity, but the
reality of millions of years of adaptation to a ruggedly physical
existence will not just go away because desks were
invented.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span><span class="calibre12">Like it or not,
we remain the possessors of potentially strong muscle, bone, sinew, and
nerve, and these hard-won commodities demand our attention. They were
too long in the making to just be ignored, and we do so at our peril.
They are the very components of our existence, the quality of which now
depends on our conscious, directed effort at giving them the stimulus
they need to stay in the condition that is normal to them. Exercise is
that stimulus.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span><span class="calibre12">Over and above
any considerations of performance for sports, exercise is the stimulus
that returns our bodies to the conditions for which they were designed.
Humans are not physically normal in the absence of hard physical effort.
Exercise is not a thing we do to fix a problem – it is a thing we must
do anyway, a thing without which there will always
</span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">be</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre12">
problems. Exercise is the thing we must do to replicate the conditions
under which our physiology was – and still is – adapted, the conditions
under which we are physically normal. In other words, exercise is
substitute cave-man activity, the thing we need to make our bodies, and
in fact our minds, normal in the 21st century. And merely normal, for
most worthwhile humans, is not good enough.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span class="calibre7"><span><span class="calibre12">An athlete’s
decision to begin a strength training program may be motivated by a
desire to join a team sport that requires it, or it might be for more
personal reasons. Many individuals feel that their strength is
inadequate, or could be improved beyond what it is, without the carrot
of team membership. It is for those people who find themselves in this
position that this book is intended.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Why
Barbells?</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span><span class="calibre12">Training for
strength is as old as civilization itself. The Greek tale of Milo serves
to date the antiquity of an interest in physical development, and an
understanding of the processes by which it is acquired. Milo is said to
have lifted a calf every day, and grew stronger as the calf grew larger.
The progressive nature of strength development was known thousands of
years ago, but only recently (in terms of the scope of history) has the
problem of how best to facilitate progressive resistance training been
tackled by technology.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span><span class="calibre12">Among the first
tools developed to practice resistance exercise was the barbell, a long
metal shaft with some type of weight on each end. The earliest barbells
used globes or spheres for weight, which could be adjusted for balance
and load by filling them with sand or shot. David Willoughby’s superb
book, </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">The Super Athletes</span></span></span><span><span
class="calibre12"> (A.S. Barnes and Co., 1970) details the history of
weightlifting and the equipment that made it
possible.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span><span class="calibre12">But in a
development unforeseen by Mr. Willoughby, things changed rapidly in the
mid-1970s. A gentleman named Arthur Jones invented a type of exercise
equipment that revolutionized resistance exercise. Unfortunately, not
all revolutions are universally productive. Nautilus utilized the
“principle of variable resistance,” which claimed to take advantage of
the fact that different parts of the range of motion of each limb were
stronger than others. A machine was designed for each limb or body part,
and a cam was incorporated into the chain attached to the weight stack
that varied the resistance against the joint during the movement. The
machines were designed to be used in a specific order, one after another
without a pause between sets, since different body parts were being
worked consecutively. And the central idea (from a commercial
standpoint) was that if enough machines – each working a separate body
part – were added together in a circuit, the entire body was being
trained. The machines were exceptionally well-made and handsome, and
soon most gyms had the obligatory, very expensive, 12-station Nautilus
circuit.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span><span class="calibre12">Exercise
machines were nothing new. Most high schools had a Universal Gladiator
multi-station unit, and leg extensions and lat pulldowns were familiar
to everybody who trained with weights. The difference was the marketing
behind the new equipment. Nautilus touted the total-body effect of the
complete circuit, something that had never before been emphasized. We
were treated to a series of before-and-after ads featuring one Casey
Viator, an individual who had apparently gained a considerable amount of
weight using only Nautilus equipment. Missing from the ads was the
information that Mr. Viator was regaining size he previously had
acquired through more conventional methods as an experienced
bodybuilder.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span><span class="calibre12">Jones even went
so far as to claim that strength could be gained on Nautilus and
transferred to complicated movement patterns like the Olympic lifts
without having to do the lifts with heavy weights, a thing which flies
in the face of exercise theory and practical experience. But the
momentum had been established and Nautilus became a huge commercial
success. Equipment like it remains the modern standard in commercial
exercise facilities all over the world.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span><span class="calibre12">The primary
reason for this was that Nautilus equipment allowed the health club (at
the time known as the “health spa”) industry to offer to the general
public a thing which had been previously unavailable. Prior to the
invention of Nautilus, if a member wanted to train hard, in a more
elaborate way than Universal equipment permitted, he had to learn how to
use barbells. Someone had to teach him this. Moreover, someone had to
teach the health spa staff how to teach him this. Such professional
education was, and still is, time-consuming and not widely available.
But with Nautilus equipment, a minimum-wage employee could be taught
very quickly how to use the whole circuit, ostensibly providing a
total-body workout with little invested in employee education.
Furthermore, the entire circuit could be performed in about 30 minutes,
thus decreasing member time on the exercise floor, increasing traffic
capacity in the club, and maximizing sales exposure to more traffic.
Nautilus equipment quite literally made the existence of the modern
health club possible.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span><span class="calibre12">The problem, of
course, is that machine-based training did not work as it was
advertised. It was almost impossible to gain muscular bodyweight doing a
circuit. People who were trying to do so would train faithfully for
months without gaining any significant muscular weight at all. When they
switched to barbell training, a miraculous thing would happen: they
would immediately gain – within a week – more weight than they had
gained in the entire time they had fought with the 12-station
circuit.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span><span class="calibre12">The reason that
isolated body part training on machines doesn’t work is the same reason
that barbells work so well, better than any other tools we can use to
gain strength. The human body functions as a complete system – it works
that way, and it likes to be trained that way. It doesn’t like to be
separated into its constituent components and then have those components
exercised separately, since the strength obtained from training will not
be utilized in this way. The general pattern of strength acquisition
must be the same as that in which the strength will be used. The nervous
system controls the muscles, and the relationship between them is
referred to as “neuromuscular.” When strength is acquired in ways that
do not correspond to the patterns in which it is intended to actually be
used, the neuromuscular aspects of training have not been considered.
Neuromuscular specificity is an unfortunate reality, and exercise
programs must respect this principle the same way they respect the Law
of Gravity.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span><span class="calibre12">Barbells, and
the primary exercises we use them to do, are far superior to any other
training tools that have ever been devised. </span></span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="bold">Properly performed,
full-range-of-motion barbell exercises are essentially the functional
expression of human skeletal and muscular anatomy under a load.
</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre12">The exercise is
controlled by and the result of each trainee’s particular movement
patterns, minutely fine-tuned by each individual limb length, muscular
attachment position, strength level, flexibility, and neuromuscular
efficiency. Balance between all the muscles involved in a movement is
inherent in the exercise, since all the muscles involved contribute
their anatomically determined share of the work. Muscles move the joints
between the bones which transfer force to the load, and the way this is
done is a function of the design of the system – when that system is
used in the manner of its design, it functions optimally, and training
should follow this design. Barbells allow weight to be moved in exactly
the way the body is designed to move it, since every aspect of the
movement is determined by the body.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span><span class="calibre12">Machines, on the
other hand, force the body to move the weight according to the design of
the machine. This places some rather serious limitations on the ability
of the exercise to meet the specific needs of the athlete. For instance,
there is no way for a human being to utilize the quadriceps muscles in
isolation from the hamstrings in any movement pattern that exists
independently of a machine </span></span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">designed
</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre12">for this purpose. No
natural movement can be performed that does this. Quadriceps and
hamstrings </span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">always</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre12">
function together, at the same time, to balance the forces on either
side of the knee. Since they </span></span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">always</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre12">
work together, why should they be </span></span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">exercised</span></span></span><span><span
class="calibre12"> separately? Because somebody invented a machine that
lets us?</span></span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span><span class="calibre12">Even machines
that allow multiple joints to be worked at the same time are less than
optimal, since the pattern of the movement through space is determined
by the machine, not the individual biomechanics of the human using it.
Barbells permit the minute adjustments during the movement that allow
individual anthropometry to be expressed.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span><span class="calibre12">Furthermore,
barbells require the individual to make these adjustments, and any other
ones that might be necessary to retain control over the movement of the
weight. This aspect of exercise cannot be overstated – the control of
the bar, and the balance and coordination demanded of the trainee, are
unique to barbell exercise and completely absent in machine-based
training. Since every aspect of the movement of the load is controlled
by the trainee, every aspect of that movement is being
trained.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>There are other benefits as well. All of
the exercises described in this book involve varying degrees of skeletal
loading. After all, the bones are what ultimately support the weight on
the bar. Bone is living, stress-responsive tissue, just like muscle,
ligament, tendon, skin, nerve, and brain. It adapts to stress just like
any other tissue, and becomes denser and harder in response to heavier
weight. This aspect of barbell training is very important to older
trainees and women, whose bone density is a major factor in continued
health.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span><span class="calibre12">And barbells are
very economical to use. In practical terms, five or six very functional
weight rooms – in which can be done literally hundreds of different
exercises – can be built for the cost of one circuit of any brand of
modern exercise machine. Even if cost is not a factor, utility should
be. In an institutional situation, the number of people training at a
given time per dollar spent equipping them might be an important
consideration in deciding which type of equipment to buy. The correct
decision about this may directly affect the quality of your training
experience.</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The only problem with barbell training
is the fact that the vast, overwhelming majority of people don’t know
how to do it correctly. This is sufficiently serious and legitimate a
concern as to justifiably discourage many people from training with
barbells in the absence of a way to learn how. This book is my humble
attempt to address this problem. This method of teaching the barbell
exercises has been developed over 30 years in the commercial fitness
industry, the tiny little part of it that remains in the hands of
individuals committed to results, honesty about what works, and the
time-honored principles of biological science. I hope it works as well
for you as it has for me.</span></span></p>

</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<hr />
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The squat has been the most important,
yet most poorly understood, exercise in the training arsenal for a very
long time. The full-range-of-motion exercise known as the squat is the
single most useful exercise in the weight room, and our most valuable
tool for building strength, power, and size. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The squat is literally the only exercise
in the entire repertoire of weighted human movement that allows the
direct training of the complex movement pattern known as
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">hip drive
</span></span></span><span>– the active recruitment of the muscles of
the posterior chain. The term </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">posterior chain</span></span></span><span> refers to the
muscles that produce hip extension – the straightening out of the hip
joint from its flexed (or bent) position in the bottom of the squat.
These muscle groups – also referred to as the </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">hip
extensors</span></span></span><span> – are the hamstrings, the glutes,
and the adductors (groin muscles). Because these important muscles
contribute to jumping, pulling, pushing, and anything else involving the
lower body, we want them strong. The best way to get them strong is to
squat, and if you are to squat correctly, you must use hip drive, which
is best thought of as a shoving-up of the sacral area of the lower back,
the area right above your butt. Every time you use this motion to propel
yourself out of the bottom of the squat, you train the muscles in the
posterior chain. </span></span></p>

<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>All styles of squatting tend to make the
quads sore, more so than any of the other muscles in the movement. This
soreness occurs because the quads are the only knee extensor group,
while the hip extensors consist of three muscle groups (hamstrings,
glutes, adductors). They comprise more potential muscle mass to spread
the work across – if they are trained correctly. Given this anatomical
situation, we want to squat in a way that maximizes the use of all the
muscle that can potentially be brought into the exercise and thus be
strengthened by it. So we need a way to squat that involves the
posterior muscle mass, making it operate up to its potential for
contributing to strength and power. The low-bar back squat is that
way.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Done correctly, the squat is the only
exercise in the weight room that trains the recruitment of the entire
posterior chain in a way that is progressively improvable. These are the
things that make the squat the best exercise you can do with barbells
and, by extension, the best strength exercise there is. The squat trains
the posterior chain muscles more effectively than any other movement
that uses them because none of the other movements involve enough range
of motion to use them all at the same time, and none of the other
movements train this long range of motion by preceding their
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">concentric</span></span></span><span>, or shortening,
contraction with an </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">eccentric</span></span></span><span>, or lengthening,
contraction, which produces a stretch-shortening cycle, or
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">stretch
reflex</span></span></span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The squat’s stretch-shortening cycle is
important for three reasons:</span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<ol>
<li><span>The stretch reflex stores energy in the viscoelastic
components of the muscles and fascia, and this energy gets used at the
turnaround out of the bottom. </span></li>
<li><span>The stretch tells the neuromuscular system that a contraction
is about to follow. This signal results in more contractile units firing
more efficiently, enabling you to generate more force than would be
possible without the stretch reflex. </span></li>
<li><span>Because this particular loaded stretch is provided by the
lowering phase of the squat (which uses all of the muscles of the
posterior chain over their full range of motion), the subsequent
contraction recruits many more motor units than would be recruited in a
different exercise.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The conventional deadlift, for example,
uses the hamstrings and glutes, but it leaves out much of the adductors’
function, and starts with a concentric contraction in which the hips
start out well above the level of a deep squat. No bounce, shorter range
of motion, but very hard anyway – harder, in fact, than squatting, due
to the comparatively inefficient nature of the dead-stop start – yet not
as useful to overall strength development. Plyometric jumps can be deep
enough and might employ the requisite stretch reflex provided by the
drop, but they are not incrementally increasable the way a loaded
barbell exercise is, they can be damned tough on the feet and knees for
novices, and they are not weight-bearing in the sense that the whole
skeleton is loaded with a bar on the shoulders. In contrast, the squat
uses all the posterior chain muscles, uses the full range of motion of
the hips and knees, has the stretch-shortening cycle inherent in the
movement, and can be performed by anybody who can sit down in a chair,
because we have very light bars that can be increased in weight by very
small increments. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The term “posterior chain” obviously
refers to the anatomical position of these muscular components. It also
indicates the nature of the problems most people experience under the
bar, trying to improve their efficiency while squatting. Humans are
bipedal creatures with prehensile hands and opposable thumbs, a
configuration that has profoundly affected our perception as well as our
posture. We are used to doing things with our hands in a position where
our eyes can see them, and we are therefore set up to think about things
done with our hands. We are not used to thinking about our nether
regions, at least those unrelated to toilet functions. The backside of
your head, torso, and legs are seldom the focus of your attention unless
they hurt, and they remain visually unobservable even with a mirror. The
parts you can see in the mirror – the arms, chest, and abs, and the
quads and calves if you’re wearing shorts – always end up being the
favorite things for most people to train. They are also the easiest
parts to learn how to train because they involve or are facilitated by
the use of our hands, and we are very “handsy”
creatures.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The hard parts to train correctly are
the ones you can’t see. The posterior chain is the most important
component of the musculature that directly contributes to gross movement
of the body, as well as being the source of whole-body power. The
posterior chain is also the hardest part to learn how to use correctly.
This would be easier if you didn’t have any hands: how would you pick up
a table without the ability to grab the edge of the thing and lift it?
You’d get under it and raise it with your upper back, or squat down and
drive up with your hips against the undersurface of it, or lie down on
your back and drive it up with your feet, because those would be the
only options open to you. But your hands shift your focus away from
these options and enable you to avoid thinking about them at all. So
posterior chain matters remain largely unexplored by most people, and
this makes their correct use a rather groundbreaking
experience.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span> You will find that the posterior
aspects of squatting and pulling present the most persistent problems,
require the greatest amount of outside input from coaches and training
partners, and will be the first aspects of form to deteriorate in the
absence of outside reinforcement. For coaches, the posterior chain is
the hardest part of the musculature to understand, to explain, and to
influence. But it is also the most critical aspect of human movement
from the perspective of athletic performance, and the mastery of its
lore can determine the difference between an effective coach and a
slightly-more-than-passive observer, between an effective athlete and
one who merely moves. </span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Much is made of “core” strength, and
fortunes have been made selling new ways to train the core muscles. A
correct squat perfectly balances all the forces around the knees and the
hips, using these muscles in exactly the way the skeletal biomechanics
are designed for them to be used, over their full range of motion. The
postural muscles of the lower back, the upper back, the abdominals and
lateral trunk muscles, the costal (rib cage) muscles, and even the
shoulders and arms are used isometrically. Their static contraction
supports the trunk and transfers kinetic power from the primary
force-generating muscle groups to the bar. The trunk muscles function as
the transmission, while the hips and legs are the engine.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Notice that the “core” of the body is at
the center of the squat, that the muscles get smaller the farther away
from the “core” they are, and that the squat trains them in exactly this
priority (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_005.html#filepos45311"
class="calibre9">Figure 2-2</a>). Balance is provided by the interaction
of the postural muscles with the hips and legs, starting on the ground
at the feet and proceeding up to the bar. Balance is controlled by a
massive amount of central nervous system activity under the conscious
direction of the athlete’s mind. In addition, the systemic nature of the
movement, when done with heavy weights, produces hormonal responses that
affect the entire body. So not only is “the core” strengthened, but it
is strengthened in the context of a total physical and mental
experience. </span></span></p>
<br />

<br />

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure 2-2.</span></span></span><span>
Total-body power development originates in the hips, and the ability to
generate power diminishes with distance from the hips. Note also that
the farther from the center of the body a body part is, the greater the
angular velocity with which the body part can move, enabling the
application of power through acceleration. From a concept by David
Webster, versions of which have been used by Tommy Kono and Bill Starr.
This concept has recently gained new traction under the names “core
strength,” “core stability,” and “functional training.” It seems rather
obvious to the author that an athlete with a 500-pound squat has a more
stable “core” than that same athlete would with a 200-pound
squat.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The squat is poorly understood because
it involves the use of many muscles – more than most people realize –
and most of the people who don’t understand it have never done it
correctly themselves. This means that they can’t appreciate the true
nature of the movement and the interactions of all the muscles
functioning in a coordinated manner, since to truly understand a thing,
you must experience it personally. The more people who learn to squat
correctly, the more people there will be who understand the squat, and
then, like ripples in a pond, knowledge and strength will spread. This
process starts here, with you. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Loaded Human
Movement</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>A basic understanding of the nature of
loaded human movement – the ways that the skeletal system translates the
force of muscle contraction into movement as the body interacts with its
environment – is essential to understanding barbell training. A few
simpl e lessons, which can be learned through observing the squat, are
equally applicable to all other barbell exercises. The most basic of
observations is that when a barbell is loaded, the force that provides
the weight of the barbell is gravity. And gravity – always, everywhere,
every time – operates in a straight line perpendicular to the surface of
the earth. Gravity is generated by mass. In this particular case, we are
concerned with the mass of the planet, which has conveniently organized
itself into the general shape of a sphere – ignoring minor surface
features like mountains and valleys – under the influence of this
gravity. So the surface of the earth is assumed to be horizontal for
this definition; after all, a rock dropped on the side of a hill still
falls in the direction we define as </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">down</span></span></span><span>.
This fact has yet to be disputed, and the principle has risen to the
status of Physical Law: there are no known examples of unimpeded objects
falling in a path described as “non-vertical.” The force of gravity
acting on the bar is always acting straight down in a vertical line.
Therefore, the most efficient way to oppose this force is by acting on
it vertically as well. So not only is a straight line the shortest
distance between two points, but a straight </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">vertical</span></span></span><span> line is also the most
efficient bar path for a barbell moving through space in a gravitational
framework. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>In fact, the work done on a loaded
barbell must be analyzed on the basis of this framework.
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">Work</span></span></span><span> is defined as the amount
of </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">force</span></span></span><span> (the influence which
causes a change in motion or shape) multiplied by the </span><span><span

Pounds on the bar being a unit of force, work can be expressed in
foot-pounds. But since gravity operates in only one direction, straight
down, the work done against gravity consists only of the distance the
barbell moves vertically. Any other motion imparted to the bar – i.e.,
horizontal motion, in a direction either forward or back relative to the
lifter – cannot be considered work against gravity, although force will
be utilized when the motion is produced. Rolling the barbell around the
room constitutes work against gravity </span><span><span

barbell changes,</span></span></span><span> because gravity influences
the mass of the barbell in only one direction – down. </span></span></p>

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Next, when a barbell is supported by a
human body, the lifter and the barbell must be considered as a system
for any analysis that applies to their combined mass. The center of mass
(COM) of the human body in the standing “normal anatomical position” is
a point in the middle of the hips, approximately level with the sacrum.
When you squat down below parallel, the geometry of the system changes
to place the COM in the air somewhere between your thighs and your
torso. The COM of the loaded bar is in the middle of the bar on your
back. The </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">lifter/barbell system</span></span></span><span> has a
COM somewhere between the two. As the weight of the bar increases, the
system’s COM moves closer to the bar until, at very heavy weights, the
barbell itself approximates the system’s COM. For practical purposes, we
will assume that the barbell will be loaded with heavy weights and that
the barbell is usually the object that we must be concerned with
balancing as we move it through the range of motion of the exercise.

class="calibre9">Figure 2-5</a>, a dashed line illustrates a vertical
relationship between the barbell on the back and the middle of the foot
against the floor. It should be intuitively obvious that the
lifter/barbell system will be in balance when it is directly over the
middle of the foot, with the </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">mid-foot</span></span></span><span> position – right
under the arch of the foot – being the point of interaction with the
ground that is the farthest away from both the forward and rearward
edges of contact. Very simply, the mid-foot is exactly halfway between
either end of the sole of the shoe. It is therefore the most stable
position, the one which would take the most movement to disrupt, and
therefore the one naturally favored by the body, loaded or not. The
heavier the weight on the bar, the more precisely the bar position
calibrates to the mid-foot. In other words, at light weights, where the
mass is primarily that of the body itself, the bar may be forward of the
mid-foot in a position of stability, and as the weight increases, the
bar comes into balance more directly over the mid-foot.

angle is formed by the plane of the torso and the femur. The knee angle
is formed by the femur and the tibia. The back angle is formed by the
plane of the torso and the floor. Note that the barbell is directly over
the mid-foot and is therefore in balance.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The body prefers stability to pretty
much everything else. For example, the ankle joint – the actual point of
rotation – is behind the mid-foot, and the calf muscles attach at the
heel at about the same distance behind the ankle as the mid-foot is in
front of it. The calf muscles exert tension on the heel behind the ankle
to counter the effects of the leverage between the ankle and the
mid-foot (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_005.html#filepos56200"
class="calibre9">Figure 2-6</a>). The body selects the mid-foot as the
balance point by inclining the shins and doing the calf work necessary
to maintain this more stable position. In addition, the gastrocnemius,
the hamstrings, and the quadriceps all cross the knee joints,
stabilizing the position of the knees relative to the ankles, and the
hips are embedded in a web of muscle, tendon, and ligament that permits
the upright body to squat down under load and maintain a position of
balance over the mid-foot.</span></span></p>
<br />

<br />

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure 2-6.
</span></span></span><span> The mid-foot balance point is the position
favored by the body for balance. The point of rotation at the bottom of
the leg – the ankle – does not function as the last piece of the kinetic
chain due to the stability provided by the anchoring system of the lower
leg, calf muscles, and foot; this system maintains the tibial angle and
transfers force to the sole of the foot. Considering the system this way
allows us to calculate balance from the mid-foot position, the point of
greatest stability against the floor.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Consider the unloaded lifter: if you
stand up straight with your hands on your hips and lean forward, even a
little, you can feel the weight shift to the balls of your feet and feel
the increased tension in your calves as you apply some force to the mass
of your body above your feet to keep from falling forward. If you lean
back, you can feel the shift onto your heels – lean back far enough, and
you will have to actually hold your arms out in front of you to change
your center of mass so that you don’t fall back. (Our bodies have
evolved to move forward, and forward imbalances are more naturally
handled by our anatomy.) You settle into a position of balance when the
greatest amount of force is needed to perturb the position, or when the
least amount of force is needed to maintain the position. When you
stand, this position is where your COM is over the mid-foot, and when
you squat down and stand back up, your body’s COM is in balance when it
travels in a vertical line directly over this point. Since you will do
most barbell exercises (except the bench press) while standing on your
feet, this mid-foot balance point becomes a critically important concept
in the analysis of good exercise technique.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Let’s assume that the bar in <a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_005.html#filepos54413"
class="calibre9">Figure 2-5</a> weighs 315 pounds. Were the bar forward
of this balance point, it would still weigh 315 pounds, but the effort
required to move it through its range of motion would be greater. The
eccentric and concentric work done on the 315 pounds would be harder due
to the bad leverage position generated by the distance the bar was out
of balance. And the isometric stress of stabilizing the load in the bad
leverage position adds quite significantly to the effort. Keeping the
315-pound bar directly over the mid-foot through the complete range of
motion (ROM) constitutes the most efficient way the work
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">should</span></span></span><span> be done during the
lift. When the bar is off-balance, the added energy you must expend due
to the leverage of the off-balance load makes 315 much harder to lift.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>It doesn’t take much of an imbalance for
the leverage to increase to the point where the rep is missed. Imagine
the bar on your back in a position 12 inches in front of the mid-foot as
you try to squat; this is an awkward position with even 30% of your 1RM
(1 rep max), and the heavier the weight gets, the smaller the imbalance
you can deal with. You can easily see that this continuum ends up with
essentially </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">zero</span></span></span><span> amount of deviation
tolerable at 1RM loads. This concept applies to every barbell exercise
where the load must be balanced. So, “good technique” in barbell
training is easily and understandably defined as the ability of the
lifter to keep the bar vertically aligned with the balance point. The
ability to maintain this balanced relationship between the bar and the
ground is one of the many things trained with barbells that are not
trained in other exercise methods. Since balance is an important
characteristic of most human physical endeavors, this is one more reason
to base your training on barbell exercises.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span><a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_005.html#filepos54413"
class="calibre9">Figure 2-5</a> also shows the angles we use to analyze
the movement of the body under the bar during the squat. The
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">hip
angle</span></span></span><span> is the angle formed by the femur and
the plane of the torso. Even though the spine is curved when held in the
correct position to bear weight under the bar, it is held rigid during
the squat, so we can use the concept of “the plane of the torso” to
describe the mechanical behavior of this segment under the bar. The
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">knee
angle</span></span></span><span> is formed by the femur and the tibia,
effectively illustrating the relationship between the thigh and the
“shank” (as the lower leg segment is called). The </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">back
angle</span></span></span><span> is formed by the plane of the torso and
the floor, which is assumed to be horizontal (meaning </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">level</span></span></span><span>,
perpendicular to the force of gravity). </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>These angles describe the relationships
of their constituent segments to each other under the load of the
barbell. The back angle is said to be either more </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">vertical</span></span></span><span> or more
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">horizontal</span></span></span><span>, while the knee and
hip angles are either more </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">open</span></span></span><span> or more
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">closed</span></span></span><span>. Control of the
position of these angles depends on the muscles operating the bones that
form the angles. We know that the lifter/barbell system will be in
balance when the bar is directly over the middle of the foot, and the
heavier the bar, the more precisely this position must be kept. Even if
the weight is light enough to remain in a position of imbalance, the
lifter will expend more energy than he would if the bar were in balance.

out-of-balance bar. </span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>If the bar is on the front of the
shoulders, as in the front squat, this bar position will require a very
vertical back angle if the bar is to be kept over the mid-foot, as <a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_005.html#filepos65207"
class="calibre9">Figure 2-8</a> illustrates. Notice the knee angle made
necessary by this position: it is very closed. And notice the hip angle:
it is much more open than it would be with a more horizontal back angle.
In this position, the hamstrings are shortened because their proximal
attachments on the pelvis and their distal attachments at the knee are
as close together as they can be at the bottom of a squat. Here, the
hamstrings are functioning isometrically to hold the torso in the nearly
vertical position required of the front squat, a much easier position to
hold than a more horizontal back angle because of the reduced leverage
against the hips (much more on this later). But when the hamstrings are
shortened, there is not enough contractile capacity left to contribute
much to hip extension. In essence, the hamstrings are already contracted
in the bottom of the front squat and can’t contract much more. This
leaves the glutes and adductors on their own to produce hip extension,
and this is why your butt gets so sore when you front-squat heavy: it’s
having to do all the work the hamstrings normally help with in a squat.

<br />

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure 2-8.
</span></span></span><span>Squat variations commonly seen in the gym.
</span>(A) The low-bar squat, our preferred position and the form
referred to in this text as “the squat.” (B) The front squat, used to
catch and recover from a clean and as an assistance exercise by Olympic
weightlifters. </span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The upshot of this situation is that the
front squat leaves out much of the hamstrings’ function, and we’d like
to use the hamstrings when we squat so that we can get them strong. The
front squat is therefore a poor choice for training the posterior chain.
To best recruit the hamstrings, and let them contribute the most they
can to hip extension, we need to use a squat form that produces a more
closed hip angle and a more open knee angle. At the bottom of this
squat, the hamstrings are contracted isometrically – that is, they are
stretched out proximally, by the attachments at the pelvis, even as they
are shortened distally because of the flexing knees. As the knees and
hips extend during the ascent, the hamstrings have to work hard to
maintain tension on the pelvis, and to control the effects of the
increased leverage demands of the more-horizontal back angle. The back
angle largely determines the hip angle, and the back angle enables the
hamstrings to contribute more force to the squat. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>And when we use that more horizontal
back angle, the bar must be placed on the back such that the bar is over
the middle of the foot. The lower the bar is on the back, the more
horizontal the back angle can be. The bar should therefore be in the
lowest secure position it can occupy on the back, right below the spine
of the scapula – that bump on your shoulder blade you can feel when you
reach across and touch the back of your shoulder. Any lower than this,
and the bar scoots down a little every rep of the set.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>If the adductors – the groin muscles –
get their share of the load, too, that adds muscle mass to the exercise.
When we use a moderate stance with shoulder-width heels, toes pointing
out at about 30 degrees, and knees shoved out so that the thighs stay
parallel to the feet, then the groin muscles stretch out as the hips are
lowered. If the muscles are stretched out, they are in the position they
must be in to contract and contribute force to the hip extension. The
muscles that hold the knees out – the external rotators of the hip – are
engaged as well, thus adding to the muscle mass involved in the
squat.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The low-bar squat, or in this book, just
the Squat, is not the same form used by suit-and-wraps-equipped
powerlifters, who are trying to get the most out of their squat suit, an
expensive, very tight singlet that is designed to resist hip flexion and
store elastic energy in the eccentric phase, and therefore aid hip
extension. To this end, some powerlifters use a very wide stance and as
vertical a shin position as they can produce. Some lifters use a
high-bar position with low elbows, a more vertical back angle, and an
upward eye gaze (quite different from the squat style used in this
book). A wide stance and vertical shins open the knee angle and close
the hip angle, thus permitting the more effective use of the suit/hip
extension. Knee wraps are used to resist knee flexion, and like the
squat suit, they store elastic energy during the eccentric phase. Our
stance, which is not nearly as wide, permits more forward travel of the
knees and more use of the quadriceps. In fact, every aspect of the
technique used in our version of the squat has been chosen specifically
to maximize the amount of muscle mass and the range of motion used so
that we can lift as much weight as possible through that range of motion
and thus get stronger.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>If the bar is placed high on the back –
on top of the traps, where most people start off carrying it because
it’s an easier and more obvious place for a bar – the back angle must
accommodate the higher position by becoming more vertical to keep the
bar over the mid-foot. If the back angle is more vertical, the knee
angle must become more closed because the knees get shoved forward when
the hips open up (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_005.html#filepos65207"
class="calibre9">Figure 2-8</a> again). In other words, the higher bar
position makes the back squat more like the front squat, and we don’t
want to front-squat for general strength development because it doesn’t
effectively train the source of whole-body power: the posterior
chain.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The high-bar, or “Olympic,” squat has
been the preferred form of the exercise for Olympic weightlifters for
decades. This seems to be largely a matter of tradition and inertia,
since there are compelling reasons for weightlifters to use the low-bar
position, too. Since the squat is not a contested lift in weightlifting,
and since Olympic lifters front-squat to directly reinforce the squat
clean anyway, the reasons for weightlifters to use the low-bar squat in
training must involve other considerations. The squat makes you strong,
and weightlifting is a strength sport; even if it is terribly dependent
on technique, the winner is still the one who lifts the most weight. The
high-bar position may be harder, but the low-bar position uses more
muscle, allows more weight to be lifted, and consequently prepares the
lifter for heavier weights. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>If an argument on the basis of
specificity is to be made, the low-bar squat is also more applicable to
the mechanics of Olympic weightlifting than the high-bar squat. The
low-bar position, with the weight sitting just below the spine of the
scapula, much more closely approximates the mechanics of the position in
which the bar is pulled off of the floor. As the discussions of pulling
mechanics in the Deadlift and Power Clean chapters illustrate, the
shoulder blades are directly above the bar when it leaves the floor in a
heavy pull, and they stay there until the bar rises well above the
knees. This is true for both the clean and the snatch, with the snatch
being done from a position even less similar to the Olympic squat than
the clean is. Low-bar squats done with this similar, relatively
horizontal back angle train the movement pattern more directly than does
the high-bar version, which places the back at a higher angle due to the
higher position of the bar on the traps. And they do it through a nice,
long range of motion due to the fact that the squat goes to a deeper hip
position than the start position of either the snatch or the clean and
jerk. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>If the back angle is kept constant for
both the low-bar squat and the pull from the floor (which it must be,
see <a
href="#filepos471602"
class="calibre9">back angle discussion in the deadlift chapter</a>),
they are very similar movements – more similar than a high-bar squat and
a pull of any type. If an argument is to be made for squatting with a
form specific to the motor pathway requirements of the sport, the
low-bar position would be that form. And if an argument is made that the
squat need not be similar, the low-bar squat still makes more sense
because it can be done with heavier weights. </span></span></p>

and Importance</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The full squat is the preferred
lower-body exercise for safety as well as for athletic strength. The
squat, </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">when
performed correctly</span></span></span><span>, not only is the safest
leg exercise for the knees, but also produces more stable knees than any
other leg exercise does. Correctly is deep, with hips dropping below
level with the top of the patellas (see <a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_005.html#filepos35086"
class="calibre9">Figure 2-1</a>). Correctly is therefore full range of
motion.</span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span> Any squat that is not deep is a partial
squat, and partial squats stress the knees and the quadriceps without
stressing the glutes, the adductors, or the hamstrings. In full squats,
the hamstrings, groin muscles, and glutes come under load as the knees
are shoved out, the hips are pushed back, and the back assumes the
correct angle on the way down for hip drive to occur on the way up. At
the very bottom of the squat, the hips are in flexion and the pelvis
tilts forward with the torso. In this deep squat position (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_005.html#filepos76326"
class="calibre9">Figure 2-9</a>), several muscle groups reach a full
stretch: the adductors (attached between the medial pelvis and various
points on the medial femur), and the glutes and external rotators
(attached between the pelvis and the lateral femur). Here, the function
of the hamstring muscles (attached to the tibia and to the ischial
tuberosity of the pelvis), is primarily isometric, since they don’t
necessarily change length on the way down. In the bottom of the squat,
the tightened hamstrings, adductors, glutes, and external rotators
provide a slight rebound, which will look like a “bounce”; this is the
stretch reflex we discussed earlier. The tension of the stretch pulls
backwards on the tibia, balancing the force produced by the anterior
quadriceps attachment on the tibial tuberosity. The hamstrings finish
their job, with help from the quads, adductors, and glutes, by extending
the hips.</span></span></p>

balanced by the posterior force provided by the hamstrings. The depth is
the key: partial (high) squats (B) predominantly work the quadriceps and
therefore lack balance.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>A partial squat done with an upright
torso and vertical back angle is typical of most people’s attempts to
squat, because we have all been told that the back must be vertical to
reduce </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">shear</span></span></span><span>, the sliding forces that
occur along a segment in rotation. Shear between the vertebral segments
is supposed to somehow disarticulate your spine, despite the fact that
this cannot and has not ever occurred. But in a misinformed effort to
protect the back, this advice results in a lot of unnecessary stress on
the knees. As we’ve already discussed, however, the vertical back angle
fails to fully load the hamstrings. Therefore, they cannot exert the
posterior force needed to oppose and balance the anterior force exerted
by the quadriceps and their attachments to the front of the tibia, below
the knee. (In other words, there’s no force pulling backwards to balance
the forces that are pulling the knees and tibias forward.) The result is
an actual anterior shear on the knee. And like a front squat, the
partial squat also forces the knees quite forward of the mid-foot – much
more so than the low-bar squat form we will be using, which keeps the
knees back and uses the hips as the primary mover of the load. This lack
of posterior support produces an anterior-dominant force distribution on
the knee: the further back the hips are, the more hip muscle you use,
and the further forward the knees, the more quad you use. Many cases of
patellar tendinitis have been caused by this incorrect squat technique.
Even when partial squats are done with the correct back angle, they fail
to work the full range of motion and therefore fail to perform to their
potential as an exercise. </span></span></p>

<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The hamstrings benefit from their
involvement in the full squat by getting strong in direct proportion to
their anatomically proper share of the load in the movement, as
determined by the mechanics of the movement itself. This fact is often
overlooked when the medical community considers anterior cruciate
ligament (ACL) tears and their relationship to conditioning programs.
The ACL stabilizes the knee: it prevents the tibia from sliding forward
relative to the femur. As we have already seen, so does the hamstring
group of muscles. Underdeveloped, weak hamstrings thus play a role in
ACL injuries, and full squats strengthen the hamstrings. In the same way
the engaged hamstrings protect the knees during a full squat, hamstrings
that are stronger due to full squats can protect the ACLs during the
activities that we are squatting to condition for. With strong
hamstrings and the knees-back position provided by the low-bar version
of the squat, the hips bear most of the stress of the movement. So
athletes who are missing an ACL can safely squat heavy weights because
the ACL is under no stress in a correctly performed full squat (see <a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_005.html#filepos81130"
class="calibre9">Figure 2-11</a>). </span></span></p>

2-11.</span></span></span><span> Forces on the knee in the squat. The
hamstrings and adductors exert a posterior tension on the tibia, and the
net effect of the anterior quadriceps tendon insertion is an anterior
force against the tibial plateau. With sufficient depth and correct knee
position, anterior and posterior forces on the knee are balanced. The
anterior (ACL) and posterior cruciate ligaments (PCL)stabilize the
anterior and posterior movements of the distal femur relative to the
proximal tibia. In a correctly performed squat, these ligaments are
essentially unloaded.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Another problem with partial squats is
the fact that very heavy loads can be moved due to the short range of
motion and the greater mechanical efficiency of the quarter-squat
position. A trainee doing quarter-squats is predisposed to back injuries
as a result of the extreme spinal loading that comes from putting a
weight on his back that might be more than three times the weight that
he can safely handle in a correct deep squat. A lot of football coaches
are fond of partial squats because they allow the coaches to claim that
their 17-year-old linemen are all “squatting” 600 pounds. Your interest
is in getting strong (at least it should be), not in playing meaningless
games with numbers. If it’s too heavy to squat below parallel, it’s too
heavy to have on your back.</span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>There is simply no other exercise, and
certainly no machine, that produces the level of central nervous system
activity, improved balance and coordination, skeletal loading and bone
density enhancement, muscular stimulation and growth, connective tissue
stress and strength, psychological demand and toughness, and overall
systemic conditioning than the correctly performed full squat. In the
absence of an injury that prevents its being performed, everyone who
lifts weights should learn to squat, correctly.</span></span></p>

<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>We will approach the squat in two
phases: first unloaded, to solve problems associated with the bottom
position, and then loaded, to learn how to apply the bottom position to
the hip drive used for heavier weights. Since the majority of the
problems with the squat happen at the bottom, this method expedites the
process quite effectively. </span></span></p>

<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>We will use a fairly neutral foot
placement, with the heels about shoulder width apart and the toes
pointed out at about 30 degrees. An excessively wide stance causes the
adductors to reach the end of their extensibility early, and excessive
narrowness causes the thighs to jam against the belly. Both of these
problems prevent you from reaching proper depth. Shoulder width is
proportionate to pelvic width in most people, and experience has shown
that this width works well for most of the population.
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="bold">Many people will
assume a stance with toes pointed too forward, so you may need to point

<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Now comes the crucial part of learning
the movement. You are going to assume the position you will be in at the
bottom of a correct squat, without the bar. This method works well
because you can easily correct any errors in position before the bar
adds another variable to the system. And if you’ve already been in the
correct bottom position </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">without</span></span></span><span> the bar, getting into
that position again </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">with</span></span></span><span> the bar is easy. Assume
the correct stance and squat down, all the way. Don’t even think about
stopping high; just go on down to the bottom. Sometimes a lack of
flexibility or a failure to point your toes out enough will alter your
stance on the way down, so make sure you have assumed the correct foot
position.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Next, put your elbows against your
knees, with the palms of your hands together, and shove your knees out
(<a href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_005.html#filepos87867"
class="calibre9">Figure 2-13</a>). This will usually be a decent bottom
position, and if your flexibility is not great, the position will act as
a stretch if you maintain it for a few seconds. Remember,
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="bold">proper depth is
essential in the squat</span></span></span><span>, and this low bottom
position lays the groundwork for your attaining good depth from now on.

<br />

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure 2-13.
</span></span></span><span> Use your elbows to stretch into the correct
position at the bottom. The femurs are parallel to the feet, the feet
are flat on the ground at the correct angle, the hips are back, the
knees are just a little forward of the toes, and the back is at an angle
(about 45 degrees) that will place the bar over the middle of the
foot.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Stay in the bottom position for a few
seconds to allow for some stretching. If you get fatigued by holding the
position, your flexibility might not be quite what it should be. Stand
up and rest for a few seconds. Then go back down to get some more
stretching done and to reinforce your familiarity with the bottom
position. This is the most important part of learning to squat correctly
because good depth is the difference between a squat and a partial
squat.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Now is the time to notice some important
details about the bottom position. Your feet are flat on the floor, your
knees are shoved out to where they are in a parallel line with your
feet, and your knees are just a little in front of your toes. Your back
should be as flat as you can get it, but if it’s not perfect, we’ll fix
it later. Also notice that your back is inclined at about a 45-degree
angle, not at all vertical. You may think it’s vertical, but it won’t be
and it’s not supposed to be. And your eyes are looking down at the floor
a few feet in front of you.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>After you’ve established the bottom
position, come up out of the bottom by driving your butt straight up in
the air. </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">Up</span></span></span><span>, not forward. This movement
keeps your weight solidly over the whole foot instead of shifting it to
the toes. Think about a chain hooked to your hips, pulling you straight
up out of the bottom (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_005.html#filepos90807"
class="calibre9">Figure 2-14</a>). Don’t think about your knees
straightening out, don’t think about your feet pushing against the
floor, and don’t even think about your legs. Just drive your hips up out
of the bottom, and the rest will take care of itself. </span></span></p>

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure 2-14.
</span></span></span><span> An interesting way to visualize hip drive in
the squat.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>This important point should not be
missed. Our previous discussion about hip drive and the use of the
hamstrings in the squat applies here. The squat is not a leg press, and
the idea of pushing the floor with the feet provides an inadequate
signal for the hamstrings, adductors, and glutes to provide their power
out of the bottom. Hip extension is the first part of the upward drive
out of the bottom. When you think about raising your butt up out of the
bottom, the nervous system has a simple, efficient way to fire the
correct motor units to initiate hip drive. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Eye gaze direction plays an important
part in this process of driving the hips, and it is introduced even
before the bar becomes part of the squat. Looking up at the ceiling when
squatting has so many detrimental effects on proper technique that it is
absolutely amazing that so many people still advise their lifters to do
it. It interferes with the correct bottom position, with hip drive out
of the bottom, and with correct chest position. It changes the focal
point from a close, manageable spot to one that is farther away. And the
neck position that results from looking at the ceiling is inherently
unsafe: to place the cervical spine in extreme overextension and then to
place a heavy weight on the trapezius muscles directly underneath it is,
at best, imprudent. The normal anatomical position for the cervical
spine is the preferred position when the weights get
heavy.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The habit of looking up is also a very
difficult problem to correct if it has existed for any length of time.
Lifters whose high school football coaches taught them to look up during
the squat often have a very difficult time with changing the eye gaze
direction, even when we have effectively demonstrated that looking down
works so much better. An embedded movement pattern is always easier to
perform than a new one, and it will be the default movement pattern if
conscious control is shifted to another aspect of the new
technique.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Do an experiment or two to demonstrate
for yourself the effect of gaze direction. Assume the bottom position
with knees out, toes out, and heels down. Put your chin down slightly
and look at a point on the floor 4 or 5 feet in front of you. Now drive
your hips up out of the bottom, and take note of how this feels. Now do
the same thing while looking at the ceiling. If you have a training
partner or coach, get in the bottom position and have him block your
hips, with a hand placed firmly on your lower back and pushing straight
down, so that you have something to push up on, but not so that he
pushes you forward. Push up against the resistance while looking down at
your floor focus point, and note the effectiveness of your hip drive and
the power it produces. Then try this movement again while looking up.
You will discover an amazing thing – that the chin-down (looking down
keeps the chin down), eyes-down position enables your hip drive to
function almost automatically. In contrast, the upward eye gaze pulls
the chest forward, the knees forward, and the hips forward – just a
little, but enough to produce a profound effect. It slacks the
hamstrings and all the posterior muscles we are trying to keep tight so
that we can use them to drive the hips up. The first time you do this
experiment will convince you that looking down is more efficient.

ability to use the posterior chain during the drive up from the bottom.
</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Looking at the floor also provides the
eyes with a fixed position reference. Using this reference, you can
easily identify any deviation from the correct movement pattern and
adjust it as it happens. The ceiling also provides a reference, but the
neck position is unsafe, and anything you’re looking at upward will be
farther away than the floor when you’re at the bottom of the squat. It’s
hard to imagine a room in which the floor isn’t closer to the eyes than
the ceiling is; the floor is therefore more useful as a reference –
smaller movements can be detected against the closer point.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">Most people will have more trouble with this change in
their eye gaze direction than with any other aspect of this squatting
method.</span></span></span><span> To correct the error of looking up,
fix your eyes on a position on the floor 4 or 5 feet in front of you. If
you’re training close to a wall, find a place to look at that is low on
the wall and results in the same neck position. Stare at this point, and
get used to looking at it so that it requires no conscious effort. Most
people, if they are looking down, will not raise their heads to the
point where neck position is affected. Inventive coaches have used
tennis balls for the purpose of demonstrating a chin-down, chest-up
position (<a

<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Adding the
bar</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Now you’re ready to squat. You have
already been in the position you will go to at the bottom, and now
you’re just going back down there with the bar. First, chalk your hands.
Chalk is always a good idea because it dries out the skin. Dry skin is
less prone to folding and abrasion than moist skin and therefore is less
prone to problem callus formation. If the weight room is not equipped
with chalk, bring your own. If the gym complains, change gyms.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The squat begins at the power rack or
the squat stands, whichever is available. Set the rack height so that
the bar in the rack is at about the level of your mid-sternum. Many
people will perceive this as too low, but it’s better to be a little low
taking the bar out of the rack than to have to tiptoe back into the rack
with a heavy weight. Often, this position in the empty rack will look
low because the diameter of the bar sitting in the hooks tells the eye a
different story about its true height in the rack. When the bar is
placed in the rack, the eye will be more comfortable with the setting.
And remember, we are placing the bar in a lower position than the top of
the traps, so you’ll need the rack lower than you think. You’d rather
have the rack set a little too low than a little too high, and most
people are not as tall as they think they are. </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">Most people will want to use a
position in the rack that is too high. </span></span></span><span>If
your shoulders are not flexible enough to assume the low-bar position at
first, they should stretch out over a couple of weeks.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Face the bar. Always an empty bar at
first. ALWAYS. There will be plenty of time very soon to add weight.
Take an even grip on the bar, measured from the markings placed on the
bar for this purpose. A standard power bar has 16–17 inches between the
ends of the outside knurl, and 32 inches between the finger marks, those
one-eighth-inch gaps in the knurl indicating a legal bench-press grip.
Grip width for the squat will obviously vary with shoulder width and
flexibility, but in general, the hands will be between these two
markings on this type of bar. A narrower grip allows a flexible person
to better support the bar with the posterior muscles of the shoulders
when the elbows are lifted, and a wider grip allows an inflexible person
to get more comfortable under the bar. In either case, a narrower grip
tightens your shoulder muscles so that the bar is supported by muscle
and doesn’t dig into your back.<br />

<br />
<br />
The thumbs should be placed on top of the bar so that the wrists can be
held in a straight line with the forearms. The elbows should be cranked
up to trap the bar between the hands and the back. If a lack of
flexibility in the chest and shoulders prevents your achieving this
position, use the high-bar position until proper stretching can make you
flexible enough to get the bar down to a better position. If you’re
flexible enough now, take a grip wide enough to permit straight wrists
under the bar, and then with each set, narrow your grip a little until
it is tight and secure. Mark this position as the grip you will
use.<br />

<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>With your grip in place, and your hands

you feel at the top of the shoulder blades – the spine of the scapula –

class="calibre9">Figure 2-20</a>). It should feel as though the bar is
resting on a “shelf” under the traps and on top of the posterior
deltoids. This action tightens the muscles of your back and lifts your
chest, placing the thoracic spine in an extended, straight position and
thereby fixing many of the problems encountered with a round-back
position. Enormous weights can be safely handled this way later.
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">Most people

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>First and foremost,</span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="bold"> ALWAYS STEP BACK OUT OF THE RACK.
ALWAYS. NEVER PUT THE BAR BACK IN THE RACK BY STEPPING BACKWARDS. NEVER.
</span></span></span><span>This cannot be done safely. You should never
be in a position to have to step backwards and rack a weight at the end
of a set. You cannot see the hooks, and even if you have spotters, there
will eventually be a wreck. If you do this, or permit it to be done by
someone you’re training, you are a fool. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Take the bar out of the rack in the same
position in which it is to be squatted, with the torso and shoulders
tight, the chest and elbows up, the head position down, and both feet
under the bar. Everything should be the same as it is for the full
squat, so take the bar off of the hooks by extending the knees and hips,
just as in the top of a squat. In this way, any weight can be taken
safely out of the rack. Many problems are caused by doing this
improperly. It is very common to take the bar out of the rack with a
loose back and chest, and then attempt to tighten everything just before
squatting. It is obviously much more effective to tighten the muscles
and </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">then</span></span></span><span> take the weight onto
tight muscles than it is to take the weight, let it mash down into your
back through loose muscles until it stops on some crucial skeletal
component, and then try to tighten everything up underneath it.<br />

<br />
<br />
Likewise, taking the bar out with one foot back and only one foot under
the bar, like a lunge, is a bad habit, one that everybody gets away with
when the weight is light but that can cause back problems from the
unevenly stressed hips when the weight gets heavier. Unrack the bar
exactly like it is in a squat, even when it is light, and you’ll have no
problems later when it is heavy.<br />

<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Once the bar leaves the rack, don’t take
a hike with it, backing up three or four steps before setting up to
squat. This is unnecessary, and it could become a problem if the set is
heavy, the spotters are unreliable, or the trip back to the rack is just
too far on this particular day. One step back out of the rack with good
form is enough to clear the rack and allow the spotters to do their job
while minimizing the trouble of getting the bar back
home.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The stance should be the same as the one
used during the stretch. Again, heels should be about shoulder width
apart, with toes pointed out about 30 degrees. </span><span><span

with the empty bar. THE EMPTY BAR. All of the groundwork has been laid,
the correct bottom position is fresh in your mind, and you are now in
the correct starting position. Everything you are about to do is the
same as you did during the stretch. Only two things are different: one,
you don’t have your elbows available to help push your knees out, so you
need to do this with your brain. And two, don’t stop at the bottom. Just
go down and immediately come back up, driving your butt straight up, not
forward, out of the bottom. Now, take a big breath and hold it, look
down at a spot on the floor about 4–5 feet in front of you, and
squat.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>You should be in good balance at the
bottom of the squat, having already been there when you stretched. Your
weight should stay evenly balanced over the middle of your feet.<br />

produced when the bar is just below the spine of the scapula and
directly over the middle of the foot, the back is held tight in lumbar
and thoracic extension, the knees are parallel to the correctly placed
feet, and the correct depth is reached. Flopping forward allows the bar
to drop forward of the mid-foot.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />
The reference point your eyes have on the floor should help you maintain
position all the way down and all the way up. Balance problems usually
indicate a back angle that is too vertical, so make sure you’re sitting
back and leaning forward enough. <span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">Most people have a picture in their minds of a vertical
torso during the squat.</span></span></span><span> Remember that the
back angle will not be vertical at all; sit back, lean forward, and
shove your knees out. </span>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Get someone to verify that your depth is
good, and DO NOT accept anything less than full depth, ever, from this
point on. If your impartial critic tells you that you’re high, check
your stance to make sure that it’s wide enough but not too wide, that
your toes are out enough, and that your knees are tracking parallel to
your feet. While he’s being helpful, get him to check your eye gaze
direction and to remind you to look down every rep. If you’re sure the
form is fairly good, do a set of five and rack the bar. If the form is
good except for the depth, the squat itself will act as a stretch IF
YOUR KNEES ARE OUT. And most of the time, if you are high, it is because
your knees are not out. </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">Most people who have problems with the squat – at this
rank novice level as well as later on – do not shove their knees out
enough.</span></span></span><span> If the squat is crazy bad, rack the
bar and repeat the pre-squat procedure, focusing on the knees-out part.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>To rack the bar safely and easily, walk
forward until it touches the vertical parts of the rack. Find the
uprights, not the hooks. You can’t miss the uprights, and if you touch
them, you’ll be over the hooks. If you try to set the bar directly down
on the hooks, you can and will eventually miss it on one side. Big
wreck. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The general plan is to do a couple more
sets of five reps with the empty bar to nail down the form, and then add
weight, do another set of five, and keep increasing in even increments
until the next increase would compromise the form. Sets of five are a
good number to learn with – not so many that fatigue affects form during
the last reps, but enough to establish and practice the technique while
handling enough weight to get strong. Increments for increasing the
weight between sets will vary with the trainee. Lightweight,
unconditioned kids need to go up in 10–15 lb or 5–7.5 kg jumps. Older or
stronger trainees can use 20–30 lb or 10–15 kg increments. Decide which
jumps best fit your situation, being conservative since it is your first
day. </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">Most
people will try to increase the weight by increments that are too large
for this point in the teaching method.</span></span></span><span> Go on
up in weight, practicing good form and making sure to keep good depth,
until you can tell that the next jump up would alter your form. Then do
two more sets at the current weight, for a total of three sets across
with the heaviest weight. And that is the first squat
workout.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Leverage and Moment –
The Basis of Barbell Training</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>If the system of barbell training you
are about to study is to be more than just another collection of
opinions about the subject, it must proceed from more than just the
history of the activity, the preferences of the author, and the observed
habits of those people who happen to be performing at a high level.
History is filled with examples of less-than-efficient behavior that is
nonetheless effective; personal preferences quite often reflect an
unquenchable bias; people are often good at things without knowing
exactly why, and these folks might be even better at them if they did.
It seems likely that barbell training would be more efficiently
performed if it had more in common with engineering than with astrology
– more like physics class than birthday party – and it would be more
effectively coached if it were developed from mechanics rather than from
folklore.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>An understanding of the forces affecting
the lifter and the barbell is essential to forming an accurate analysis
of the movements used in barbell training. The squat, bench press,
deadlift, press, and power clean are potentially complicated multi-joint
exercises that form the basic movements employed in barbell training.
The complexity of these movements is mitigated by the fact that they are
all quite natural expressions of loaded human movement – the ways that
the skeletal system translates the force of muscle contraction into
movement as the body interacts with its environment. But if these
natural movements are to effectively and efficiently function as
exercises, they must be tailored to specifically cause the use of the
most muscle mass over the longest range of motion so that the most
weight can be lifted and thus produce the most effective strength
adaptation. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>If we develop an accurate description of
each exercise based on an understanding of what each one is supposed to
accomplish in terms of movement against a loaded bar, how this movement
is most efficiently accomplished using muscular contractile force
translated through the skeletal components that transfer the force to
the load, and which physical adaptations will accompany an ability to
handle increasing loads in each particular movement pattern, we will
have what can be described as a </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">model</span></span></span><span>
of the exercise. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>This model must be grounded in an
understanding of the principles that govern the motions within a
physical system. And a grasp of each model makes the performance and
coaching of each movement more straightforward, logical, and
understandable. The science of </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">classical mechanics
</span></span></span><span>studies the effects of forces on the motions
of material bodies. An extensive treatment of this science is obviously
outside the scope of our discussion, but a basic understanding of a few
of its concepts is critical to the development of an accurate model for
each exercise in this method of barbell training. These concepts are
important to understand because the system of levers you will use to
lift the barbell – your muscles moving your skeleton, loaded by the
barbell in a gravitational framework – obeys the laws of mechanics, and
you must know them before you can analyze your lifting to optimize the
way you do it. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>So, let’s start with the most basic
concept and build on it. As noted previously, the agent that produces
the weight of the loaded barbell is </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">gravity</span></span></span><span>. It is produced by the
mass of the planet, and for our purposes the planet is assumed to be a
uniform sphere. Every unimpeded object will fall in a direction
perpendicular to the surface of this sphere. The term “level” is used to
denote a surface parallel to the surface of the planet, so that if an
object is dropped, it always falls perpendicular to “level,” and we
describe this path as </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">vertical</span></span></span><span>. The force exerted by
the weight of a loaded bar is therefore always vertical and down, and
the only way to oppose the force of a freely moving barbell is with a
force that is vertical and up. Horizontal force may be applied to the
bar during its trip through the rep, but none of the horizontal force
can contribute to the vertical motion of the bar. So, to the extent that
squatting, pulling, or pressing a loaded bar works against gravity, the
vertical components of the force do the work. This means that the most
efficient bar path for a barbell moving in a gravitational framework is
always a straight vertical line; not only is this path the shortest
distance between the two points, but any force applied in any other
direction is not work against the force of gravity (see <a
href="#filepos50749"
class="calibre9">Figure 2-3</a>).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Gravity is expressed as three primary
forces that affect the lifter/barbell system: tension, compression, and
moment.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">Tension</span></span></span><span> is the force
transmitted along an object that would elongate </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">if</span></span></span><span> it
were deformable (not every object is deformable under normal gym
circumstances). An example would be the body of a lifter hanging from
the chin-up bar.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">Compression</span></span></span><span> is the force
transmitted along an object that would get shorter if it were
deformable. Compression is the opposite of tension, and an example would
be the body of a lifter standing under the loaded squat
bar.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Both tension and compression are said to
be </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">axial</span></span></span><span> forces because they are
expressed parallel to the axis of the force that generates them,
gravity.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">Moment</span></span></span><span> is force that tends to
cause a rotation about an axis. It is the force that is transmitted down
a wrench handle to turn a bolt. Moment can also be thought of as
“leverage” or bending force.</span></span></p>

the expressions of the force of gravity across the lifter/barbell
system.</span></span></span></p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>When the bar is carried on the back, or
overhead in the lockout position of the press, the force it applies is
compression. When the bar hangs from the arms in a deadlift or a clean,
the force along the arms is tension. The bones transmit compressive
force, and the connective tissues and muscles transmit tension. Both the
connective tissues and the bones working together transmit moment
(leverage). If the bar is supported overhead and then lowered in an arc
to the hang position of the deadlift, all three forces – compression at
the top, moment as the arms travel through the arc to the body, and
tension as the bar comes to rest on the legs – can be experienced in
that order. </span></span></p>

</p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>A </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">moment
arm</span></span></span><span> is the distance between a point of
rotation and the point at which the rotational force is applied,
measured at 90 degrees from the point of the force application. When
you’re using a wrench, for example, the moment arm is the distance along
the handle, between the point of rotation (the bolt) and the force that
causes the rotation (your hand), </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">measured at 90 degrees to the
force</span></span></span><span>. Moment is the force transmitted along
a rigid bar to act on a pivot, or </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">fulcrum</span></span></span><span>. The moment arm (the
term “lever arm” is synonymous) is essentially a way to calculate the
amount of moment force generated by a lever: </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">the moment force is the force
applied to the bar multiplied by the length of the moment
arm.</span></span></span><span> At one end of the system, force is being
applied to the bar. At the other end of the system, the turning force is
being resisted by the object being turned, so that along the rigid bar,
force is acting in two directions. (For this reason, moment is a
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">shear</span></span></span><span> force, in contrast to
the axial forces of tension and compression.) The “moment arm” is the
effective distance over which the system operates. The longer the moment
arm is, the more turning force is produced by the actual force applied
to the bar.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The most effective angle to pull on the
wrench handle is perpendicular to it. This is intuitively obvious to
anyone who has ever used the device; you adjust the position of the jaws
on the conveniently designed hexagonal head – shaped this way for just
this purpose – so that you can pull on the wrench at right angles to it,
regardless of the angle at which the job causes the wrench to fit on the
bolt. </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">If you
pull at any angle other than 90 degrees, some of the force will be
either compression or tension along the wrench
handle</span></span></span><span> – 90 degrees is the only angle at
which </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">all</span></span></span><span> of the pulling force
causes the wrench to turn the bolt. Since 90 degrees is the most
effective angle at which to pull, any other angle is only as effective
as the distance along the moment arm measured at 90 degrees, thus the
convention of measuring its length at this angle (see <a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_006.html#filepos133213"

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span

2-27.</span></span></span><span> The moment arm is the distance between
the point of rotation and the point of the application of force along a
rigid segment, measured at 90 degrees from the point of force
application. In barbell training, gravity provides the force, and
gravity always acts vertically and down.</span></span></span></p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The amount of turning force that can be
applied to the bolt varies with the length of the moment arm (the
distance from the working end of the wrench to your grip, measured at 90
degrees to your pull) and the amount of force applied to it (how hard
you pull on the wrench). You can increase the amount of turning force
either by pulling harder or by lengthening the handle – by getting a
longer wrench or extending its length with a “cheater pipe.”
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>In barbell training, the turning force
is the force of gravity acting on the barbell, and the moment arms are
the horizontal distances between barbell and joint along the segments of
the body</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="bold">
</span></span></span><span>over which this force acts. The instant the
knees and hips are unlocked and our diagnostic angles come into
existence along the back, thigh, and shank segments in the squat, moment
arms come into existence between the end points of these segments and
the location of the barbell relative to the segment and the balance
point under the mid-foot. The force of gravity always operates straight
down − the hand turning this particular wrench is gravity, and it’s
always pulling straight down from the bar. So we can calculate the
moment arms along the segments as measured perpendicular to the bar.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>This means that the length of the moment
arms along the back segment in the squat will always be the horizontal
distance between the bar and the hips.<br />

<br />
<span id="filepos136670"
class="calibre1">For the thigh segment, the moment arms will be the
horizontal distance between the bar and the hips, and the bar and the
knees, since the femur is bisected by the gravity vector, and the moment
arm can be considered from either hip or knee. The hip extensors “see”
the femur moment arm between the hip and the bar, and the knee extensors
“see” the femur moment between the knee and the bar. Likewise, along the
shank segment between knees and ankles, the moments can be regarded as
between bar and ankles, and between bar and knees.</span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The moment arm between the bar and the
hips will thus vary with the bar position on the back and the angle at
which the back is inclined. If the bar is in the low position advocated
here, the distance between hips and bar is shorter than it would be if
the bar were in the higher position. But since the bar must be
maintained over the mid-foot balance point, the lower bar position
requires a more horizontal back angle. And for the same reason, the more
vertical back angle compensates for the longer distance between bar and
hips in the high-bar position.<br />

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span

changes and the segment length is held constant (</span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">bottom</span></span></span><span>
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">panels</span></span></span><span>), the moment arms can
be varied.</span></span></span></p>
<p><br />
<br />
<span>The moment arm – the horizontal distance – between hips and
barbell in both positions may indeed be the same length. But we don’t
use the low-bar position because it reduces moment force on the back
segment; </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="bold">we use
it because the more horizontal back angle, closed hip angle, and open
knee angle place the hips further behind the mid-foot balance point, so
the hamstrings, glutes, and adductors have to work harder to maintain
the angle and come up out of the bottom than they do when the knees are
farther forward and the hips are closer to the
bar.</span></span></span><span> This anatomical manipulation adds their
mass to the muscles moving the load, and thus also enables heavier
weight to be used.</span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>There is another way to consider the
moments active in the lifter/barbell system. In each case, a moment arm
involves a force on one end, a point of rotation on the other end, and a
segment transmitting the force in between. Consider the effect of the
bar on your shoulders as it relates to the balance point at the
mid-foot. If the bar moves forward or backward from its ideal position
directly over the mid-foot – i.e., you apply any force horizontally to
the bar – and the mid-foot balance point is thought of as a point of
rotation, then between the bar and the mid-foot, a rotational force is
created that acts along the whole system. This horizontal force creates
a moment arm that is expressed </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">vertically</span></span></span><span> along the body
between mid-foot and barbell.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Now, it is true that the foot is a flat
surface (the sole of your shoe) in contact with another flat surface
(the floor), and the actual point of rotation nearest the floor would be
the ankle. But given that the calf stabilizes the ankle, that the load
shifts in relation to the mid-foot if the bar and your body move forward
or backward, and that the greater the weight and distance, the larger
the effect, the system behaves like a moment arm acting on a point of
rotation at the mid-foot. This leverage has the potential to add quite a
bit to the force needed to overcome the weight of the bar, which happens
as the bar moves forward of the balance point. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Forward is the usual direction of
off-balance movement due to the vagaries of human anatomy – the ankle is
behind the mid-foot, the knees articulate forward, and the eyes are
forward-directed. Most people who have been training for more than a
couple of weeks will not put themselves in the rather awkward position
of moving back with the bar on the shoulders. And since the body is in
an asymmetrical position at the bottom of a squat or a deadlift, with
more of the body behind the bar than in front of it, it would be
simplistic to conclude that the same amount of movement forward and
backward from the mid-foot would affect the system symmetrically, i.e.,
that a forward bar movement of 3 inches would have to be reacted against
with the same force as a backward bar path deviation of the same 3
inches. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Considered in this context, the term
“out of balance” means that a moment (rotational force) exists between
the bar and the mid-foot vertically along the body, and this moment must
be controlled with an amount of force necessary to cancel its effects.
This is force that could be more productively used to lift more weight
on the bar if it were “in balance.” So your ability to control the
moment between bar and mid-foot – your ability to maintain a vertical
relationship between barbell and mid-foot – is your ability to use good
technique in lifting. </span></span></p>

<p><span class="calibre7"><span> We must consider the effects of two
systems of leverage while we squat. The moments operating horizontally
along the segments of the body are produced by the force of gravity
acting on the load. They are inherent in squatting down and standing
back up under a heavy barbell; they make up the resistance against which
we work to get strong. The moment operating vertically between the bar
and the mid-foot balance point, however, must be kept at ZERO to avoid
wasting force that could otherwise be used to lift more weight. Both of
these moments must be considered when you’re analyzing the biomechanics
of the system.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Common Problems
Everyone Should Know How to Solve</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>A correct squat will always have certain
identifiable characteristics controlled by skeletal anatomy and muscle
function. For any squat, back or front, these conditions will be
satisfied, making it relatively easy to determine whether form and
position are correct. At the top, all the skeletal components that
support the bar – the knees, hips, and spine – will be locked in
extension so that the muscular components have to exert only enough
force to maintain this position, in which compression is the primary
force on the skeletal components. The job of the muscles here is to keep
the bones lined up correctly so they can hold up the load. The bar will
be over the middle of the foot. The heavier the weight, the more
critical this position will be. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>When the squat begins its eccentric
phase, all the muscles that will ultimately extend these joints – or in
the case of the spinal erector muscles, isometrically maintain extension
under increasing stress – come under mechanical load as they resist the
leverage along the segments on the way to the bottom position. During
this ride to the bottom, the bar must maintain its position over the
mid-foot. The correct bottom position is identified by definite
anatomical position markers: </span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<ul>
<li><span>The spine will be held rigid in lumbar and thoracic
extension.</span></li>
<li><span>The bar will be directly over the middle of the
foot.</span></li>
<li><span>The feet will be flat on the ground at the correct angle for
the stance width.</span></li>
<li><span>The thighs will be parallel to the feet.</span></li>
<li><span>The hip joint will be in a position lower than the top of the
patella. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Any deviation from this position will
constitute bad technique, as will any movement on the way down or back
up that causes a deviation from this position. And actually, if you keep
the bar in the correct vertical position over the mid-foot on the way
down and back up – as if the bar were riding in a narrow slot directly
plumb to the mid-foot – you will have done it right. Your skeleton will
have solved the problem of how to most efficiently use your muscles to
get the job of squatting done. It will have done so within the
constraints imposed upon it by the mechanics of the barbell/body/gravity
system. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The position of the bar on the torso
will control the angle of the back, and the angle of the back and the
stance will control the forward or back position of the knees. When the
bar is in the front squat position, the back will be quite vertical
because this angle is necessary to keep the bar over the mid-foot and to
prevent it from falling forward off the shoulders. When the back is this
vertical, the hips are nearly directly under the bar, a position which
forces the knees well forward in front of the toes and which the ankles
must accommodate by allowing the tibias to incline (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_006.html#filepos150812"
class="calibre9">Figure 2-33</a>). This means that for the front squat,
the back angle will be nearly vertical, the hip angle will be open, and
the knee angle will be closed. For the back squat, when the bar is in
the position advocated here, just below the spine of the scapula, the
back will be at a much more horizontal angle, and the knees will be at a
point just in front of the toes (depending on your anthropometry), so
that the hip angle will be more closed and the knee angle more open. A
high-bar squat would place the back and knees in the middle of these two
more useful positions. </span></span></p>

class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure
2-33.</span></span></span><span> Bar position ultimately determines back
angle, as seen in this comparison of the front squat and the squat. Note
that the bar remains balanced over the mid-foot in each case, and this
requires that the back angle accommodate the bar position. This is the
primary factor in the differences in technique between the two styles of
squatting.</span></span></span></p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Every barbell exercise that involves the
feet on the floor and a barbell supported by the body will be in its
best balance, both during the movement and at lockout, when the bar is
vertically plumb to the middle of the foot, as discussed earlier. An
assistance exercise like the barbell curl or the goodmorning
intentionally moves the bar out of line as a part of creating the
resistance for the exercise. </span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Grip and
arms</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Grip errors are common even among
experienced lifters. The grip on the bar is the first part of your
temporary relationship with the barbell that is referred to as a
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">set</span></span></span><span>. If that grip is wrong,
none of the reps in that set will be optimal because the relationship of
the body to the bar is determined first by hand position on the bar. For
instance, an uncentered placement of the bar on your back results in an
asymmetrical loading of all the components under the bar – that is, more
weight on one leg, hip, and knee than on the other – as well as a spinal
shear. A careless approach to grip placement can result in problems with
heavy weights. Most people, as discussed earlier, will need to take an
even grip somewhere between the score mark and the end of the
knurl.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>There is, however, an important
exception to this rule: for a trainee whose shoulders have significant
differences in flexibility – as might result from an injury – a
symmetrical grip on the bar will result in an asymmetrical bar position
on the back. A tight shoulder on the left side, for example, prevents
the upper arm from assuming the same angle as that used on the uninjured
right side. The tight shoulder thus drags the bar out toward that side,
resulting in the bar’s being off-center left and out-of-level on the
back. If this is your situation – and it might require a third party or
a mirror to identify this, since it is not always easy to feel – you
will need to experiment with your grip until you find the right position
for each hand. Centered loading of the back should be your primary
concern at this stage. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>As we discussed earlier, the thumb
should be placed on top of the bar so that the wrist can be held in a
straight line with the forearm. The vast majority of people, however,
will prefer to hold the bar with a thumbs-around grip. At lighter
weights, this is fine because the load is easy to keep in place. But
when heavier weights are being used, the grip that results from
thumbs-around can create its own problems. Most people have a mental
picture of the hands holding up the weight, and this usually ends up
being what happens. The bar sits in the grip with the thumbs around the
bar, the wrists are bent back, the elbows end up directly below the
weight, and nothing really prevents the bar from sliding down the back
from this position. People who do this will eventually have sore elbows,
a horrible, headache-like soreness in the inside of the elbow that makes
them think the injury occurred doing curls. If the elbows are underneath
the weight, and the force of the weight is straight down (the nature of
gravity is sometimes inconvenient), then the wrists and elbows will
unavoidably intercept some of the weight (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_006.html#filepos155819"
class="calibre9">Figure 2-34</a>). With heavy weights, the loading can
be quite high, and these structures are not nearly as capable of
supporting 500 pounds as the back is. </span></span></p>

the hands and arms under the bar. Elbows should be elevated to the rear
with the hands on top of the bar, not placed directly under the bar,
where they intercept part of the weight.</span></span></span></p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>If the thumbs are on top of the bar, the
hands can assume a position that is straight in line with the forearms
when the elbows are raised. If you are accustomed to letting your wrists
relax into extension and letting your elbows drop, your grip might be
too narrow for your shoulder flexibility, and a slightly wider grip
would make straight wrists easier to maintain. You might also need to
actively “curl” the wrist into what will feel like flexion if you have
been passively allowing it to extend. In the correct position, the wrist
is straight, neither flexed nor extended; none of the weight is over any
part of the arm, wrist, or hand; and all of the weight is on the back
(<a href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_006.html#filepos155819"
class="calibre9">Figure 2-34</a>). Learn to carry all of the weight of
the bar safely on your back before your strength improves to the point
where this same weight carried in your hands – and thus on your wrists
and elbows – can become a problem. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Occasionally a person gets misled into
thinking that it is okay to put the hands out so wide on the bar that
the fingers or even the palms of the hands are in contact with the
plates. Bizarre as this sounds, you will eventually see this in the gym.
As grip width increases, upper-back muscle tightness decreases and
muscular support for the bar is diminished, as previously discussed. If
the posterior deltoids, rotator cuff muscles, traps, and rhomboids relax
due to a widened grip, the skeleton becomes the default support
structure. This is less than desirable. To add to the problem by placing
the hands on the plates – a ROTATING pair of objects at the far end of
the bar – is just silly. You must be in control of the bar, and this
means that it must be secure on your back and therefore in your
grip.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>As is often the case in athletics, one
problem is intimately associated with another, and the solving of one
fixes the other. A lack of shoulder tightness and failure to keep the
chest up are related problems and must be corrected together. If your
elbows drop, your shoulders relax; if you lift your elbows, your
shoulders tighten. Likewise, lifting the chest requires a contraction of
the upper back muscles, especially the superior portion of the
longissimus dorsi complex. Lifting the chest is </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">thoracic spinal
extension</span></span></span><span>, a back movement. The act of
tightening the shoulders and lifting the elbows aids the thoracic
extension muscles by helping to support the bar at the point where it is
mashing down into the back. If you do both of these things at the same
time, all the muscles under the bar tighten. And if you do this before
you take the weight of the bar onto your back, the bar cannot sink down
through loose muscle, unsupported against the skeletal components of the
shoulder. Lifting the elbows and the chest together tightens the
supporting muscles under the bar, so do this before you let the weight
bury itself in your back. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Many people seem to be making a flat,
level spot for the bar to sit on by keeping their chest parallel to the
floor. It is as if they think that bending over into a position of
spinal flexion makes the bar less likely to roll off the back. The bar
will not roll off your back if you properly grip the bar, with your
hands in the right position, and raise your elbows. When the elbows come
up and the chest comes up, the hands are pushed forward and the bar is
actually forced forward into the back, trapped between the hands and the
rack position, so it cannot go anywhere. This jamming effect creates a
tight, secure bar position that can tolerate changes of angle,
acceleration, and deceleration. </span></span></p>

</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Although the squat has an undeserved,
baseless reputation for knee injury, its greatest danger is to the
spine. Lower-back injuries – usually due to form problems – are more
common by far than knee injuries, and care must be taken to prevent
them. It’s not hard to hurt your lower back, and back injuries are the
most common workplace injury, amounting to many billions of dollars per
year in treatment costs and lost productivity. Lifters are susceptible
as well, although our problems with lower-back injuries are most often
associated with activities outside the gym. We know this because
hundreds of thousands of young lifters at the mercy of inexperienced,
pigheaded coaches are permitted to lift heavy weights with bad spinal
mechanics every day, and the rate of injury in the weight room remains
low. The most dangerous movement for the spine is flexion with rotation
under a load, and we don’t do this in barbell training – we do it when
putting the lawn mower in the back of the truck. So barbell training,
even done incorrectly, is comparatively safe. But doing it wrong is much
more dangerous than doing it correctly. Our primary concern is that
doing it wrong is also </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">inefficient</span></span></span><span>, so we’ll do it
right because that ultimately allows us to lift more weight and get
stronger, and safety will be a welcome side effect.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Understanding the role of the lower back
in lifting mechanics requires an understanding of the anatomy of the hip
and leg musculature, as well as of spinal anatomy. Remember from our
previous discussion that the spine acts as a rigid bar to transmit
moment force generated by the muscles that extend the hips and knees.
The spine is held rigid by the musculature of the trunk, and it is moved
through space by the muscles that extend the pelvis, into which the
spine is locked by the muscles of the low back.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The hamstring group consists of the
biceps femoris, the semimembranosus, and the semitendinosus, all three
of which attach to the ischial tuberosity of the pelvis. They all insert
at various points on the tibia, behind the knee on the lower leg. This
configuration means that the hamstring group crosses two joints, the hip
and the knee, and therefore technically has two functions: the proximal
function (hip extension), and the distal function (knee flexion). The
hamstrings can also act isometrically against both attachments to
control the back angle.<br />

the lumbar spine, pelvis, femur, and upper tibia and the actions of the
muscles that move them, in profile. The squat has the reputation of
being a quadriceps exercise, but the hamstrings are also strongly
developed during the full squat. (B) The spinal erectors attach to the
pelvis, ribs, and vertebrae, and extend the spine when in contraction.
This “arching” action is accomplished in conjunction with the underlying
multifidis, rotators, interspinales, and intertransversarii muscles.
When contracted, these muscles move the spine into the position shown by
the arrows.</span></span></span></p>
<p><br />
<br />
When you squat, ultimately it is hip extension – straightening out the
hip joint, their proximal function – that you produce with the
hamstrings, along with the glutes and adductors. (In reality, the
hamstrings can control hip extension, knee flexion, and back angle while
functioning eccentrically, concentrically, and isometrically; the
definitions of these functions are blurry, and are really significant
only when we isolate joints on exercise machines. The complexities of
normal movement do not lend themselves to such constructed
distinctions.)</p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Squatting power is generated by the hips
and legs and is transmitted up the rigid trunk segment to the load
resting on the shoulders. The spinal column is held rigid in its normal
anatomical position by the muscles of the back, sides, rib cage, and abs
so that the force can be safely transmitted through the trunk to the
load. Before you lift anything heavy, you squeeze your abs (really, you
squeeze everything in the vicinity of your abs) into contraction. This
squeezing transforms your trunk into what is essentially a rigid
cylinder that surrounds and supports the spine. The effect is that of a
hydrostatic column – an uncompressible column of fluid that is therefore
capable of transmitting compressive force – between the contracting
abdominal wall and the spine. The force of contraction transmitted
through this fluid medium braces the spine into the position set by the
back muscles until the load overcomes your ability to stay in position.
These muscles contract isometrically – that is, they stay in contraction
but </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">cause</span></span></span><span> no movement to occur –
and in doing so, they </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">permit</span></span></span><span> no movement to
occur.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The pelvis articulates with the spine in
the L5/S1 area of the lower back, the area above the tailbone. The
muscles of the lower back – the erector spinae group, or “spinal
erectors” – insert on the pelvis and at numerous points along the spinal
column. When these muscles are contracted, the pelvis remains in a
constant position relative to the lumbar vertebrae. The spinal erectors
and associated lower back ligaments serve to lock the pelvis and spine
into a rigid structure – to protect the vertebral column from movement
under load and to hold all these joints in their normal anatomical
positions when you’re lifting heavy loads – so that the intervertebral
discs are not damaged. This area needs to stay arched to stay safe when
you’re lifting. And this is why the pelvis must tilt forward at the same
angle as the lower back as you lean forward. </span></span></p>

anatomically correct distribution of forces across the intervertebral
discs during loading. Improper vertebral position under load can result
in either anterior or posterior squeezing of the discs and the injuries
that accompany this bad position.</span></span></span></p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>However, as the squat approaches the
bottom position, the necessary forward lean of the trunk can have a
tendency to make the lower back assume a flexed, rounded position. This
tendency is caused by the hamstring anatomy and the position of the
thighs. As squat depth increases and the torso assumes a more forward
tilt, the bottom of the pelvis (the origin point of the hamstrings)
comes under tension from the direction of the proximal tibias (the
insertion point of the hamstrings just below the knees). As the
hamstrings reach the limit of their ability to stretch, they become
tighter and begin to exert more pull on both the knees and the muscles’
pelvic attachments. If your knees are not far enough apart, your thighs
will also crowd your torso as you approach the bottom.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>There are two problems. First, your back
muscles attach at the top of your pelvis, your hamstrings attach to the
bottom, and the pelvis can pivot around the hips. So both the lower back
muscles and the hamstrings can cause pelvic movement around the hip
joints. The back muscles and the hamstrings are thus competing for
control of your pelvis, and the back muscles must win if your spine is
to stay efficiently rigid and safe. Second, if the femurs are too close
together as you approach the bottom, there is not enough space between
them for the torso to drop down low enough for a deep squat. The key is
to position the femurs, the pelvis, and the low back so that the
erectors and the hamstrings complement each other’s function.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>By shoving the knees out as you squat,
while locking the spine into extension, you remove the tendency for the
lower back to round. Shoving them out as you unlock at the top places
the femurs in external rotation, and then the muscles that perform
external rotation just keep the femurs in this position on the way down
and up. The muscles that are stretched out when externally rotated then
become active in the squat. If the knees are shoved out of the way,
hamstring extensibility plays a minor role in the ability to assume a
deep squat position. Since the hamstrings do not stretch out that much,
most people are flexible enough to squat below parallel if they do it
correctly.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Usually, the biggest problem with back
position is the trainee’s inability to identify which position the lower
back is in. A lack of </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">kinesthetic sense</span></span></span><span> – the
ability to identify the position of the body or a body part in spatial
relation to the ground or the rest of the body – is very common. Some
people have absolutely no idea that their lower back is rounded at the
bottom of the squat, or that it is arched correctly at the top of the
squat, or have any idea at all of what position their back is in. They
cannot tell an upper-back arch from a lower-back arch, and the line
between upper and lower seems to be blurred. If you ask someone with
this problem to arch his lower back, he lifts his chest, or bends over
from the waist, or performs a number of other interesting movements that
have nothing to do with lumbar extension. Many people with inflexible
hamstrings exhibit this problem, but not much hamstring flexibility is
actually required to squat correctly, and many perfectly flexible people
cannot assume a position of lumbar extension and hold it through a
squat. Some people – mostly female, as a general rule – can place the
lumbar spine into a position of </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">overextension</span></span></span><span>, and this is
bad, too, perhaps potentially more dangerous than loaded lumbar
flexion.<br />

</span></span></span><span>Lumbar overextension (</span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">female
model</span></span></span><span>) is not the correct back position to
use in the squat. It indicates a failure to engage enough abdominal
contraction to support the spine from the
anterior.</span></span></span></p>
<p><br />
<br />
This occurs when you fail to use your abs to provide the anterior
support necessary to counter the extension provided by the erectors. But
this overextension is far less common than the simple inability to
maintain lumbar extension against a heavy load in the squat or deadlift.
As it turns out, if you can’t make a voluntary concentric contraction of
the lumbar erectors – the movement commonly understood as arching the
lower back – then you have no voluntary way to <span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">keep</span></span></span><span>
the lower back in extension when this position gets hard to maintain.
Please read this again, and understand this point: </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="bold">an overextended lumbar spine is not
the position you use to squat. But if you can’t voluntarily arch your
lower back, you can’t control the erectors well enough to keep the spine
from flexing at the bottom of the squat or the start of a deadlift or
clean.</span></span></span><br />

spinal extension – arching the back – is to look for wrinkles that

<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The key to learning the correct position
for the lower back is to assume a position that is correct, and then
memorize the way it feels so that you can reproduce it every time. The
best way to do this is to lie down on your belly on the floor, put your
hands behind your head, lift your elbows, and raise your chest up off of
the floor. This is how it feels to produce a thoracic, or upper back,
extension. We want to train the lower back, so lie back down, straighten
your knees, and then lift your knees up off the floor. To increase the
sensation, try to get your quads off the floor, too. (Don’t push your
toes down into the floor to lift the knees up.) When you do this
movement correctly, you’ll be using your glutes, your hamstrings, and
most important, your lower back muscles. This is how it feels to have
your lower back in contraction. Feel this arch. Relax and do it again.
By placing your back in a position where you have to contract your
spinal erectors repeatedly, without trying to do anything else at the
same time, you can embed this new movement pattern quickly and easily,
without having to try to distinguish it from the other elements within
an unfamiliar movement. A set of 10–15 reps causes a burn in these
muscles, and when you stand up, you can feel the muscles quite well, the
movement pattern is fresh on the mind, and you can then duplicate the
movement that caused the burn.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The squat is an important exercise
because of the intricate interplay between the skeletal and muscular
components of the </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">kinetic chain</span></span></span><span> of the movement.
The feet against the floor, the lower legs, the thighs, the hips, and
the spine supporting the bar are woven together and controlled by a web
of anterior and posterior muscles and connective tissues that
continually adjust their positions relative to the balance point over
the mid-foot. Several of these muscular components – the gastrocs, the
hamstrings, and the rectus femoris – cross two joints. The roles of
these muscles are especially complex, as they operate against both
proximal and distal attachments at the same time, providing the fine
adjustments necessary for the production of force in the context of
balance.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>“Hip drive” is the term used for this
complex interplay as it relates to the pelvis. The hips provide the
power out of the bottom as the glutes, adductors, and hamstrings start
opening the hip angle. As you rise above parallel, the quads assume a
larger role in the upward drive as the hamstrings anchor the back angle.
At the top, the glutes, adductors, hamstrings, and quads finish their
simultaneous extension of the hips and knees. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Knees and hips are tied together
conceptually, as well as by the femurs. If your knees are too far
forward, your hips are, too. And if your hips are too far forward and
your knees are too far forward, either you are off-balance forward or
your back angle is too vertical, the hip angle is too open, the knee
angle is too closed, and you can’t drive up out of the bottom. Hip drive
is the basis for squatting power, and even though it is anatomically
complex, hip drive can be learned easily and quickly. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Look carefully at <a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_006.html#filepos182243"
class="calibre9">Figure 2-40</a>. As you assume the bottom position,
imagine a hand placed on your sacrum, right at the base of the spine,
and imagine pushing this hand straight up in the air with your butt.
This is as clear a picture of the process of driving the hips up as can
be drawn. If you have a training partner, revisit the hip drive lesson
from the first part of the chapter: get him to place his hand as shown
in the picture and provide some resistance to your hip drive so that you
can feel the effect. (This is also a good time to refresh your
head/eye-position lesson. Look both down and up at the ceiling while
driving against the hand, and see which direction you prefer. Twenty
bucks says it’s down.) There is only a subtle difference in appearance
between good strong hip drive and a squat that lacks this, but you will
be able to feel the power of this technique the first time you do it
correctly. </span></span></p>

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>A common error is the tendency for some
lifters to drive the hips forward instead of upward (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_006.html#filepos183464"
class="calibre9">Figure 2-41</a>). If your hips go forward, your knees
will too, causing the weight to shift forward to the toes. This shift is
bad for power because anytime the knee angle closes, the hamstrings have
shortened from the distal end, and a slack muscle is not a source of
contractile power. If the rebound out of the bottom depends on hamstring
and adductor tightness, then any relaxation of tension in these muscles
represents a loss in stored elastic energy, not to mention a loss in the
ability to contract and generate force.</span></span></p>

and open hip angles at right shorten the distance between hamstring
origin and insertion, removing much of the hamstrings’ contribution to
hip drive.</span></span></span></p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Likewise, it is common to see the hips
shift backwards instead of straight up out of the bottom. When this
happens, the back angle will have become more horizontal, the hip angle
more closed, and the knee angle more open, all in the absence of upward
movement of the bar. This means that the hamstrings have not done their
job of anchoring the back angle at their proximal attachments on the
pelvis, the knee angle has opened because the gastrocnemius failed to
anchor it, and the quads can’t contract the already opened knee (<a

<br />
As we will see often, form errors in many exercises represent the loss
of the ability to generate force due to a loss in the position required
for force production. Your best power is achieved when your hips
continue straight up out of the bottom, with your tibias, anchored by
your gastrocs, serving as anchors for your hamstrings; your glutes and
external rotators holding your femurs out; your hamstrings, glutes, and
adductors contracting against the pelvis to produce hip extension
against a constant back angle; your quads producing knee extension; and
then your knees and hips locking out simultaneously at the top. Let’s
examine the role of these muscles and skeletal components in detail.
<span id="filepos186178"
class="calibre1"></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Squat depth has been emphasized since
the beginning of this chapter, so let’s begin our analysis of hip
function with its relationship to squat depth. When we squat, the
standard range-of-motion criterion for the exercise is “below parallel,”
defined as the hip joint (identified at the apex of the hip angle, the
“corner” in your shorts over the hip) as it drops below the knee
(identified as the top of the patella). Most people who have trouble
with the squat are having trouble getting good depth while preventing
their low back from rounding. Pretty much anybody can get deep if they
allow the lumbar spine to relax into flexion. But almost every single
human being on this planet can squat below parallel with pretty good
lumbar extension if their stance is correct and if they simply shove
their knees out to the sides as they squat. At the bottom of the squat,
a type of </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">impingement</span></span></span><span> – a trapping of
soft tissue between two bones – occurs, and it is relieved by shoving
out the knees. This simple skeletal-position adjustment allows for a
below-parallel squat, and at the same time, a drastic improvement occurs
in the way the hips function.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Most people think that the main problem
with squat depth is hamstring extensibility, more commonly referred to
as “flexibility” – the ability of the hamstrings to lengthen as the
depth of the squat increases. This is not really the case, and loose,
elastic hamstrings are not the key to a deep squat. Optimal skeletal
mechanics is. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>If you stand with your heels at shoulder
width apart and point your toes out at about 30 degrees, squat down, and
keep your thighs parallel to your feet, then as your hip angle closes
and your thighs approach your torso, your femurs will track to a
position that is </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">outside</span></span></span><span> of the anterior
superior iliac spine (ASIS), the “hip pointer” that you feel right below
your waistline. But if you point your toes straight forward and let your
knees follow your toes, or even if you point your toes out but still let
your knees cave in toward the middle when you squat, then your femurs
will approach the ASIS as you approach the bottom of the squat. So as
your thighs crowd your hip pointers, they tend to trap any soft tissue
or muscles that may be in the area in between, making it harder to go
deep. (See <a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_006.html#filepos189156"

the primary factor limiting squat depth. Note that impingement does not
occur in B (right panels). This contradicts the conventional wisdom of
the hamstring-flexibility theory of squat depth, and it pleases us to do
so.</span></span></span></p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Squat depth is a function of hip angle,
the angle formed between the generalized plane of the torso and the
femur. If you try to drop down to get better depth without adjusting the
position of your femurs, you’ll get depth at the expense of a rounded
lower back because the hip angle cannot become more closed if the femurs
are impinged. The pelvis is supposed to be locked in line with the
lumbar vertebrae and held rigid by the erector spinae muscles. If the
pelvis can’t tilt forward to maintain this position because it rams into
an obstruction, the only way to keep going deeper is to round the low
back. Everybody, big belly or not, will experience this phenomenon to
one degree or another, so if you’re having depth problems, shoving the
knees out fixes these problems so often that it is a waste of time to do
anything else first.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Most people won’t do the job of keeping
their knees out unless they’re coached; the knees want to track more
medially because of the tension felt on the inside of the femurs. This
tension is produced by the adductors – the groin muscles. These five
muscles (the adductor magnus, adductor brevis, adductor longus,
pectineus, and gracilis) attach at various points along the medial and
posterior aspects of the femur, and on the ischium and pubis of the
pelvis. Tension is produced between these two bones as you squat down
and keep your knees out; this is an eccentric action for these muscles
because they lengthen on the way down – </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">if</span></span></span><span> the
femurs maintain their position parallel to the feet. As you come up out
of the squat and the hip angle opens up, the distance between the inside
of the femur and the medial pelvis shortens, so the concentric action of
the adductor muscles thus produces hip extension. (See <a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_006.html#filepos195948"
class="calibre9">Figure 2-44</a>). </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Visualize the function of the adductors
by imagining a point at the end of the inside of your thigh down by your
knee, and another point on your “seat bone,” under your butt and behind
your crotch. These points represent the attachments of the adductor
magnus. Your spinal erector muscles lock your back in extension and lock
your pelvis in line with your back, so as you squat down and make your
back more horizontal, your seat bones rotate back and away from your
knees. If your knees stay in position, pointed in the same direction as
your feet – out at about 30 degrees – the distance between the point on
the inside of your thigh and your seat bone increases. And if this
distance increases as you go down and decreases as you come up, the
muscles that get longer on the way down make the “up” part happen as
they get shorter. This is how the adductor muscles function in a
correctly performed squat and why they are considered hip extensors,
along with the glutes and hamstrings, as part of the posterior
chain.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Since the adductors tend to pull the
knees in, what keeps them out when you use your hips correctly? If
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">ad</span></span></span><span>-duction of the thighs means
pulling the distal end of the femurs (the knees) toward the midline of
the body, it seems like </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">ab</span></span></span><span>-duction would be the
movement used to keep the knees out, and that the abductors would be the
muscles that did this. But the abductors consist of only the tensor
fascia latae (TFL, a small muscle that connects the hip at the anterior
iliac crest to the lower leg), the gluteus medius, and the gluteus
minimus. Together they create hip abduction if you raise your leg out to
the side, away from your body. Since nobody actually does this, except
to demonstrate the definition of abduction in biomechanics class, this
is probably not what is going on when we squat.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>External rotation occurs when you make
your right femur rotate clockwise and your left femur rotate
counterclockwise, as when you stand up and pivot on your heels to rotate
your toes away from each other. There are at least nine muscles that
perform this function: the gluteus medius, minimus, and maximus, the
adductor minimus, the quadratus femoris, the inferior gemellus, the
obturator internus, the superior gemellus, and the piriformis. (Notice
that the external rotators include two of the abductor muscles.)
External rotation is critical to stabilizing gait mechanics through the
stride. As it relates to our analysis, the action of rotating the femurs
out is what actually occurs when you shove your knees out on the way
down to the bottom of the squat. Prove this to yourself by sitting in a
chair and rotating your femurs the same way you would if you were
standing up and pivoting on your heels to point your toes out. Using the
external rotators to set the knees in a position parallel to the feet
makes all kinds of sense when you consider that they are in an effective
position to do it and the TFL is not. So shoving the knees out at the
top of the squat, and keeping them there so that the adductors can do
their job, is accomplished by the muscles that rotate the hips
externally. These muscles anchor the thigh position that allows for both
good squat depth and the more effective use of all the muscles of the
hips.</span></span></p>

<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>When you intentionally shove your knees
to the outside as you come down into the bottom of the squat, not only
do you get the femurs away from the ASIS and the gut, but you also allow
the adductors to stretch tighter and position themselves to more
effectively contract as they reach the limit of their extensibility. A
tight, stretched muscle contracts harder than a looser, shorter muscle
does because the stretch tells the neuromuscular system that a
contraction is about to follow. A more efficient firing of more
contractile units always happens when preceded by a stretch. This
stretch reflex is an integral part of all explosive muscle contraction,
and better athletes are very good at making it happen. Test this by
trying to do a vertical jump without any drop before the jump; you will
find this virtually impossible to do because the stretch reflex is such
an integral part of the sequence of any explosive muscular contraction.
When we squat, the hips’ external rotators position the femurs so that
the adductors and the external rotators themselves can participate with
the hamstrings in the bounce, and the whole hip musculature can
contribute to squatting efficiency – </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">if</span></span></span><span> you
shove your knees out.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span> The bounce you feel when you stretch
out the hamstrings, glutes, and adductors at the bottom of the squat is
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">not</span></span></span><span> due to knee ligament
tightness or rebound. The correctly performed squat is an
ACL/PCL-neutral event. You bounce off of the stretched and tightened
components of the posterior chain and the now correctly loaded
quadriceps, and it is absolutely safe for the knees. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Your timing here is important. If the
bounce is used correctly, it will be immediately followed by a hard
drive up of the hips. It is important that the bounce is not followed by
a pause and then a drive up. The bounce must be incorporated into the
drive – it must be </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">anticipated as the first part of the
drive</span></span></span><span>. Think about the “up” drive all the way
down during the descent. Don’t think about going down while you’re going
down – think about coming up the whole time. Doing this will reduce the
tendency to separate the drive from the bounce, because the drive is
being anticipated even before the bounce occurs. The timing of your
descent and rebound is critical to the performance of good squats.
Bounce occurs optimally at the correct speed of descent. If your descent
is too fast, the bounce will be less effective, and much less safe,
because the only way to drop too fast is to relax something. Muscles
tightened in the squat descent store elastic energy; tight muscles also
keep your back, hips, and knees in the correct, safe positions. If you
are loose enough to drop into the bottom of the squat much faster than
you can come up, you need to tighten up more – and it may help to think
of this as slowing – on the way down. A loose descent can allow joints
to be jammed into positions they should not occupy, and this is how most
people get hurt squatting: getting out of good position by going down so
fast that they cannot maintain proper technique. This may be how squats
got an undeserved bad reputation. Don’t contribute to the problem by
dive-bombing into the bottom.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The limit of the adductors’ and
hamstrings’ extensibility will almost always be below parallel, as
defined earlier. The hamstrings’ length does not change that much
anyway, since the knees and hips come into flexion together during the
descent. Tension builds on the isometrically tight hamstrings as they
approach the bottom; in this way, they control the back angle and
contribute to the stretch reflex effect as the rebound occurs. A few
people lack sufficient extensibility in the posterior chain muscles, and
some people have tight joint capsule ligaments, but not nearly as many
people need stretching out as merely need the correct stance, the
correct knee position outside the ASIS, and a loud reminder to keep
their knees out. The weighted squat has few superiors in the realm of
things that go </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">stretch</span></span></span><span>, anyway, and what
little stretching is actually needed can usually be done within a few
sets of weighted squats that incorporate a correct knees-out
descent.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Our previous discussion of low-back
position can now be understood in a more complete context. A developed
kinesthetic sense of spinal position is necessary for efficient force
transfer and for effective athletic performance in general. Relying on
ligament tension and general trunk tightness is fine with very light
weights, but is really a handicap at work-set loads. If the lumbar spine
and the pelvis do not stay perfectly rigid in what can be called “pelvic
lock,” force transfer is not as efficient up the spine, and posterior
chain rebound is soft because of the less-than-efficient relationship
that a loose lumbar spine has with the pelvis and the muscles attached
to it. Rigid lumbar extension places the pelvis at a better angle to
tighten the hamstrings at the bottom, making a more efficient rebound
possible because force isn’t being absorbed by a loose lumbar spine. And
the hamstrings produce a more efficient stretch reflex with a rigid
lumbar spine at the back angle used in the low-bar squat. Think of it
this way: there is a war between the erectors and the hamstrings over
control of the pelvis, and the erectors </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">have to
win</span></span></span><span> if the back is to stay rigid and the
hamstrings are to be used effectively. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>If you do not know how to contract your
erector muscles in order to arch your lower back, with no tension from
the hamstrings interfering, this means that you do not know how to
assume this position voluntarily. You do not have the kinesthetic sense
to know when the arch is there and when it isn’t, and you can’t put your
back in this position at the bottom of a deadlift or keep it there at
the bottom of a squat when hamstring tension is at its highest. If this
is you, make it a priority to learn how to control your lower back
position.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>To recap: The complete concept of the
correct use of the hips in the squat is best understood as the use of
both an actively locked lumbar extension and actively shoved-out knees,
resulting in a below-parallel squat that incorporates a stretch reflex,
using all the muscles of the posterior chain in the most optimal way
possible. This movement pattern gets the thighs out of the way of the
pelvis so that good depth can be more easily obtained. At the same time,
it makes the squat stronger because the active use of the external
rotators holds the femurs in a position that enables both the external
rotators and the adductors to contribute to hip extension. This hip
extension produces a more effective use of more muscles over a wider
range of motion. </span></span></p>

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>In a correct back squat of the style
advocated here, there is one correct place for the knees: directly in
line with the feet so that the femurs and the feet are parallel. This
position will, for most people, be slightly out in front of the toes,
with the exact distance being determined by the anthropometry of the
individual. This basically means that the femur and the foot should be
in a straight line as seen from directly above, so there is no twisting
of the knee. Depending on your femur, tibia, and trunk dimensions, your
knees could be anywhere from very slightly behind your toes, with short
femurs and long tibias, to 3 or 4 inches in front of the toes, with long
femurs and short tibias.<br />

produce in the appearance of the bottom position of the squat. Both are
correct, but both are different due to variations in leg and trunk
length.</span></span></span></p>
<p><br />
<br />
Since your knees will be directly in line with your toes, the angle of
your feet in your stance will determine the angle of the knees as well.
As shown in <a
href="#filepos85430"
class="calibre9">Figure 2-12</a>, an angle of about 30 degrees out from
the perpendicular works for most people, although this varies as well.
This angle allows the hips to function as discussed above.</p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>By far, the two most common knee errors
are 1) knees caved in too much, and 2) knees too far forward, either
early in the descent or at the bottom. It is actually unusual to see
novices not make one or both of these errors the first time they squat.
Both errors are related to hip function and positional
awareness.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>If you allow your knees to come together
at any time during the squat, you dilute the function of the muscles
both medial and lateral to the femurs. But this problem cannot be
corrected if it is not identified. When you squat, look down even more
than usual, to a point on the floor right between your toes, where you
can clearly see your knees, and check your position. If your knees move
toward each other at any point during the squat, shove them out. You
will probably have to exaggerate this shoving-out in order for it to put
your knees in the correct position, since you thought they were in the
right position when they were coming in. When you get them back out to
parallel with your feet and keep them there for a couple of sets, you
will notice later that your adductors, and perhaps your most lateral
glutes, get sore. From our previous discussion, you know
why.</span></span></p>

people will assume unless coached to do otherwise. (B) The way to coach
knees-out.</span></span></p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Letting your knees travel too far
forward presents a different challenge. The problem with this position
is not so much that it destroys the knees (although it is not
particularly good for them), but that it has a detrimental effect on hip
drive out of the bottom. A knees-forward position produces a more acute
knee angle, and the resultant distally shortened hamstrings have less
room to contract from the other end. When the hamstrings are already
contracted, their contribution to hip extension is much less efficient
than it would be with longer, stretched-out hamstrings. It also means
that there is more moment force against the ankle/mid-foot balance point
because of the more horizontal angle of the tibia. The obvious
consequence of this difference in hamstring utilization and lower-leg
mechanics is that less weight can be used. This is what happens in the
front squat.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>To maintain the vertical back angle
required by the bar position, you must close the knee angle and open the
hip angle; the front squat therefore involves inherently shorter
hamstrings in the bottom position. A primary difference between the
front squat and the squat is that the knees drive forward in the front
squat. And if the knee angle gets too closed, some of the knee problems
inherent in the front squat – the impingement of the posterior aspect of
the meniscal cartilages between the acutely squeezed femoral and tibial
condyles – start to show up where they shouldn’t. The cause of this
knee-position error is often an incorrect understanding of where the
back should be in the squat.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>If your concept of the low-bar back
squat involves a mental image of your doing the movement with your back
in a vertical position, your perception of what you’re supposed to be
doing is wrong, and it will cause your knees to be too far forward. If
your torso is too vertical, your knees will be forced forward to
maintain the bar/mid-foot balance position. The layman’s advice to “lift
with your legs, not your back” might be part of the problem because most
people interpret this advice as involving a vertical torso and the legs
pushing the floor.<br />
<span class="calibre1"></span> </span></span></p>

<p><br />
</p>
<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure
2-47.</span></span></span><span> Quite often, the mental image of the
squat involves a vertical torso like a front squat, a position that
kills posterior chain involvement. The correct back angle is horizontal
enough that efficient hip-drive mechanics are used, and this back angle
awareness involves the correct mental image of where your torso actually
is during the squat. Don’t be afraid to lean over, sit back, and shove
your knees out.</span></span></span></p>
<p><br />
<br />
The saying should be “lift with your hips, not your back,” because
“lifting with your back” is what happens when you bend over to pick
something up and round your spine into flexion. Leaning over is a normal
part of the squat; it is required if the bar is to remain in balance
over your mid-foot. The correct mental picture, discussed <a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_006.html#filepos228946"
class="calibre9">below</a>, usually fixes this problem.</p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>If it doesn’t, there are other things
that can get the knees back. If the weight is on the heels during the
squat, the knees can’t be too far forward. Think about your heels, and
how it feels to have your weight balanced on them. Assume your squat
stance, pick up your toes, and rock back onto your heels. Once your
weight is on your heels, shove your knees out and squat. When you squat
from the heels, your knees stay back, and if you stay in balance, your
back angle will have adjusted to a more horizontal position as well.
Now, you will not be able to continue to squat on your heels because
this is also an unbalanced position. But after three or four reps, this
trick will have done its job and you will have settled into the middle
of your feet with your knees in the correct position, not too far out
over the toes. This position will feel balanced and strong, and done
correctly a few times, it will be the one you favor from then on.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>A different problem, often encountered
in more advanced trainees, is the tendency to let the knees slide
forward as the bottom approaches. This problem usually develops over
time, and the embedded movement pattern can be hard to fix if you let it
go uncorrected too long. And it is potentially complicated. If your
knees move forward at the bottom of the squat, you may have relaxed your
quads, which hold the knees open; the closed knee angle in turn shortens
the hamstrings, which then are slacked distally and therefore cannot be
used effectively for proximal hip extension. Quads maintain the knee
angle, which in turn anchors the hamstrings as they tighten with greater
squat depth and a more closed hip angle so that they can extend the hips
on the way up. Or you may have relaxed the hamstrings’ tension on the
tibias, dorsiflexed your ankles, and shifted forward to your toes from
the bottom. The soleus anchors the knee angle from the distal end, and
the gastrocnemius adds to this effect by crossing the knee joint to the
distal femur, to anchor the knee to the ankle. The squat is essentially
an interaction with the ground and your balance point over the mid-foot.
All these muscles, if relaxed at the bottom of the squat, have to be
retightened to be used effectively, and this is hard to do from what are
now terribly inefficient skeletal positions. </span></span></p>

<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The fact is that most people don’t like
to maintain tension in the quads, the calves, and the posterior chain as
they approach the bottom of the squat. It is indeed a lot of work to
maintain tension in these components as the angles become more closed,
the muscles reach the end of their ability to extend, and the tendons
become stretched and tight. Tempting as it may be to relax forward,
doing so is obviously inefficient because it eliminates the possibility
of storing elastic energy in the extensible components as they stretch
out and get nearer to the point of activating the stretch reflex as the
direction of the movement reverses. Relaxing forward also increases the
risk of injury because low-back relaxation often comes along for the
ride.</span></span></p>

<br />
</p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The answer is to learn to squat with the
knees in the proper place and to move them correctly during the descent.
If the knees are moving out as the femurs externally rotate, their
forward travel will be limited to that which is normal for your
anthropometry in a correct squat, where all of the forward knee travel
occurs in the first third or half of the descent. After that, the knees
just stay in place and the hips account for the rest of the movement.
So, from the very top, shove the knees forward </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">and</span></span></span><span>
out to the place where they will end up, just in front of the toes, and
stop them there; the rest of the descent will consist of the hips moving
back and down. Make two movements out of this for a couple of reps, and
then reduce this sequence to a smooth single motion (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_006.html#filepos219212"
class="calibre9">Figure 2-50</a>). A useful way to learn this is to
place a block of wood in front of your knees, as illustrated in <a

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>In order for this knee-control technique
to work, you’ll need to actually look down at your knees so that you’ll
know what they are doing in response to your direction. In your squat
stance, at the top with the bar in position on your back, look straight
down at a point on the floor between your toes. You will see a picture
of your knees relative to your feet, and the movement of your knees
relative to your toes will be apparent as you descend. Look at your
knees all the way down and back up a couple of times with the empty bar.
You will need to practice this because it will seem awkward at first.
But as you watch your knees change position through the movement and as
the sets get heavier, you will see exactly what the problems are and you
will have immediate feedback on what you need to do to correct them. If
your concept of the squat is correct, this technique is the best way to
fix your knee problems. </span></span></p>

<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Feet and
stance</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>As previously noted, the interaction
with the feet against the floor is central to the entire concept of the
squat. The middle of the feet is the point of balance against the floor,
and the bar must remain directly above this point for the system to be
in balance. Remember that in our recommended stance, the heels are about
shoulder width apart, with the toes pointed out at about 30 degrees.
Stance is a highly individual thing and will vary with hip width, hip
ligament tightness, femur and tibia length and proportion, adductor and
hamstring flexibility, knee joint alignment, and ankle flexibility.
Everybody’s stance will be slightly different, but shoulder-width heels,
with toes at 30 degrees, is a good place to start.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>As noted earlier, stance width will
influence knee position. For example, if you are tall with very long
femurs and relatively narrow shoulders, you need a wider stance than is
usually recommended. If you have a long torso and short legs (not that
uncommon a body type), you will need a bit narrower stance than our rule
of thumb would predict. Sometimes the foot angle needs to be adjusted
for individual situations: if you are pigeon-toed, your foot angle will
need to be slightly more forward-pointing than our model recommends, or
more commonly, in the case of out-toeing, the feet will need to be
pointed out more. These corrections are necessary to keep the correct
neutral relationship between the femur and the tibia so that no twisting
occurs in the capsular, medial, and lateral ligaments of the knee.
Expect a closer stance to place the knees more forward relative to the
toes, and a wider stance to place them farther back (see <a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_006.html#filepos223928"
class="calibre9">Figure 2-52</a>). But again, shoulder-width heels
produces the best effect for general strength training.

stance angle, and knee angle. The wider the stance, the more the toes
point out, due to the changing angle of the femurs at the pelvis as
width increases. The feet keep the tibias rotated in line with the
femurs – and keep the stress off the knees – by changing their angle to
accommodate the rotation. As explained on <a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_006.html#filepos136670"
class="calibre9">earlier</a>, the moment arm along the femur is
calculated from the position of the bar over midfoot. The knee “sees”
the moment arm from knee to bar and the hip “sees” the moment arm from
hip to bar. (</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span

</p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>A narrow-stance squat, such as that
frequently pictured in the muscle magazines, develops an aesthetically
pleasing set of quads. But since we plan to use the rest of the hip
musculature, too, it seems unwise to omit it from the training program.
It is very difficult for people of normal flexibility to get deep enough
with a narrow stance, so the hamstrings are never engaged as fully as
they would be with a more generalized wider stance. Also, the narrow
stance does not involve the groin muscles, as discussed earlier. For
this reason, it can be useful in the event of a groin injury and can be
used for several weeks while the adductors are healing. If used all the
time, however, narrow-stance squatting predisposes you to a groin injury
due to the lack of conditioning for these muscles. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>One occasionally sees powerlifters
squatting with a wide stance and their toes pointing almost forward.
Some really strong powerlifters do this to increase the joint tightness
and resultant rebound obtained by placing an additional twist on the
knee and hip ligaments. Some of the others do it because they are merely
copying what they’ve seen the strong guys do. This is a practice best
left to very experienced powerlifters. For you, it will be very
important to have all the bones of the legs and hips in the best
position to generate force without causing tendon and ligament problems.
Here is a way to see this relationship: sit in a chair with your knees
slightly bent and your feet out in front of you, without pushing hard on
the floor. Put your legs together, and note that your toes are pointing
straight forward. Spread them out wide and note that your toes are
pointing out. In both positions, your feet naturally assume a position
parallel to your femurs, and your knees are in an anatomically neutral
position, with no twisting (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_006.html#filepos223928"
class="calibre9">Figure 2-52</a>). As your knees point out, your toes
point out. The wider the knees, the more the toes point out. As the
knees widen, the femurs rotate externally, the tibias follow to keep the
knee ligaments in their normal anatomical position, and the toes point
out more because they are attached to the end of the tibias. This
anatomical relationship must be understood and respected so that
avoidable knee injuries don’t happen.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The practice of placing a block or a 2x4
under the heels is common. Most gyms keep one lying around somewhere.
People use the block to make the full squat position easier to reach,
and understanding why this works is necessary for understanding why you
should not do it. A block under the heels tilts the shins forward by
lifting the ankles and allowing the knees to move forward without
stretching the ankle joints. This shin angle closes the knee angle and
causes the hamstrings’ attachment point on the back of the tibia to move
closer to their origin on the pelvis, loosening the muscle a little and
thus decreasing the amount of stretch necessary to get to full depth.
Weightlifting shoes with a heel height of between ½ and ¾ inches provide
a little lift that helps tilt the shins enough to involve the quads a
little more, but a heel height of 1½ to 2 inches is as bad as a 2x4. If
you are having “flexibility” problems severe enough that you need a
block under your heels in order to squat deep, your problem is most
likely your stance and your knee position, as discussed earlier.

<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>There is an important mental trick that
you can use to fix most things wrong with the bar path in the squat and
all the resultant errors made by the body. The trick is amazingly
simple, and it corrects a wide variety of technique problems, from knees
to back angle, from air under the heels to a wobbly bar path. This trick
is simply keeping the barbell over the mid-foot by thinking about doing
so.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The case for barbell training was built
around the idea of balance by observing that the most efficient form to
use was that which keeps the bar in a vertical relationship with the
middle of the foot. If you do this, the back angle will be determined by
the position of the bar on the back. Furthermore, if you keep your spine
rigid, and the bar travels up and down in the imaginary slot directly
above the mid-foot, then the knees, hips, and ankles will do what they
must do to maintain this vertical relationship, and the body will solve
all the problems associated with doing so at a level beneath any
requirement for micromanagement. In a similar fashion, if you make the
bar path vertical when you are deadlifting, the biomechanics of the pull
will be correct because the task of making the path vertical causes you
to solve the problem with your “body,” not your “brain.” This concept is
an example of a </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">bar cue</span></span></span><span>, which enables the
body itself to sort out complex motor problems by jumping past the
analysis to the result. You have been solving movement problems your
whole life, and if you’re a natural athlete, you’ve been doing it well.
By giving the body a general task instead of a specific one, you move
your brain out of the way and allow your accumulated motor skills to
solve the problem. If you command the bar to move in a vertical line, it
will do so, and you will move your back, thighs, and shins in a way that
makes it do so without your having to analyze the exact
problem.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>For the squat, you do this by
constructing a mental image of an actual slot in the air for the bar to
travel within. Visualize this narrow slot over the mid-foot, extending
up into the air above you. Then visualize the bar traveling within this
slot. An amazing thing then happens: it does. With varying degrees of
precision based on your visualization skills, the bar will tend to line
up vertically with the balance point because your knees and hips will
have done the things needed to make it happen. And your visualization
skills are just as trainable as everything else. This trick is a useful
tool for all the pulls from the floor and for the press because the
mechanics of balance and bar path are the same. </span></span></p>

a misunderstanding of the mechanisms involved, overrates the likelihood
of an exercise-related cerebrovascular injury (a breathtakingly uncommon

intersection, and you have to push it out of the way or get killed, you
will open your car door, put your shoulder on the door frame, take a
great big breath, and push the car. You will probably not exhale except
to take another quick breath until the car and you are out of the way.
Furthermore, you will not even think about this because the many
millions of years your ancestors have spent pushing on heavy things have
taught your central nervous system the correct way to breathe while
pushing. Or you might find yourself grunting aloud during the effort, a
vocalization produced by a marked restriction in the airway at the
glottis; this restriction produces a similar increase in pressure during
the partial exhalation. This is perhaps the origin of the “kiyah” in
martial arts, the vocalization that allows for an increased focus of
power at the instant of the striking of a blow.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>When you inhale, your diaphragm
contracts and the volume of your thoracic cavity increases. As air flows
into your now larger lungs, pressure equalizes between the outside and
the inside. When you clamp down to hold your breath and tighten your
trunk muscles, you create a pressure gradient between the inside and the
outside. This pressure increases markedly with the intensity of the
squeeze. Since your thoracic and abdominal cavities are separated by
only your diaphragm, abdominal pressure increases, too. The spinal
vertebrae are being held in the correct anatomical position by your back
musculature. This correct position is reinforced by static pressure
transmitted to the spine across the essentially non-compressible
contents of the abdominal cavity (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_006.html#filepos236554"
class="calibre9">Figure 2-54</a>). Pressure in your abdominal and
thoracic cavities is therefore transmitted to your spine from the
anterior and lateral directions, and the spinal erectors are generating
pressure from the posterior. When pressure in the thoracic cavity
increases with a big held breath, and this pressure is increased by the
tightening of the abs and obliques, support develops for the spine as if
a rigid cylinder were surrounding the spinal column. A weightlifting
belt adds to this effect, its main function being to add support to the
cylinder from the front and sides, rather than to apply pressure from
the back. </span></span></p>

<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The conventional wisdom is that this
thoracic and abdominal pressure is also being applied to the
cardiovascular system embedded in the trunk, that the increase in
pressure is being transmitted up the vascular column to the head, and
that this increase in pressure has the potential to cause a
cerebrovascular accident (CVA), such as a stroke or a blown
aneurysm.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>This assumption ignores several facts,
most important among them the fact that for pressure across a membrane
to breach it, there must be a </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">pressure gradient</span></span></span><span>, a
difference in the pressure on either side of the membrane, or movement
cannot occur. When we use the Valsalva maneuver while lifting weights,
the whole system is pressured up so that no gradients exist across any
barriers. The same pressure being applied to the arteries in the
vascular column up the neck and into the head is also being applied to
the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the spinal canal; this fluid transmits
pressure up through the subdural space in the skull and throughout the
cerebral ventricular system, balancing cardiovascular pressure across
the blood/brain interface (Haykowsky, MJ et al., </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">Medicine &amp; Science in Sports
&amp; Exercise</span></span></span><span>, 35(1):65-68, 2003)(Figure

<p><br />
</p>
<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure
2-55.</span></span></span><span> Cerebral vascular pressure does
increase with strain and the Valsalva maneuver. However, the likelihood
of vascular rupture is mitigated by a simultaneous increase in cerebral
ventricular pressure transmitted up the cerebrospinal fluid column in
the spinal canal, which is under the same pressure as the vascular
column. The volume of the skull limits these two pressures and
stabilizes vessel structures, rather than predisposing them to
rupture.</span></span></span></p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Conventional wisdom also ignores the
fact that the cranium is essentially a pressure vessel, like a propane
tank, that is quite capable of containing high pressures. Imagine
inserting a balloon into a glass milk bottle and trying to blow the
balloon up so that it pops – obviously impossible unless you’re capable
of making the milk bottle explode, too. The pressure vessel prevents a
pressure gradient from developing between balloon and bottle. The
pressure across the membranes within the skull is contained by the
capacity of the bony encasement to control and prevent changes in
pressure, and pressure changes are required for the inter-membrane
disruptions of a CVA. The pressure will thus remain the same across all
the structures inside the skull – unless you exhale.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Conventional wisdom further ignores the
fact that aneurysms are vessel wall defects associated with genetic
predisposition and, rarely, with the response to a disease state, like
tertiary syphilis, that produces chronic inflammation of the vascular
walls. People with aneurysms have them for reasons other than the fact
that they train with weights, and the likelihood of such a person
rupturing an aneurysm while under the bar is approximately the same as
the likelihood of its happening while the person is walking across the
front yard. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Now, a little empirical evidence to help
make the case for breathing correctly under the bar. The actual rates of
cerebrovascular accidents versus orthopedic injuries provide ample
evidence that the greater risk is orthopedic. In Risser’s 1990 study
(</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">American
Journal of Diseases of Children</span></span></span><span>,
144(9):1015–7, 1990) of junior high and high school athletes from all
sports, 7.6% of all athletes incurred injuries that kept them out of
training for seven days. The rate of injury from all causes was 0.082
injuries per training year; 74% of all injuries were simple sprains and
strains, and </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">59% of all injuries were classified as back
injuries.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>In contrast, the death rate from
cerebrovascular accidents in 2004 was about 0.000512 (150,074 total) for
the </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">entire
population of the U.S.</span></span></span><span> (293 million in 2004).
The rate of survivable CVAs in 2004 was 0.00305 (895,000). So even if we
compare the rate of orthopedic injury in a specialized small population
engaging in exercise with the rate of CVA in the population of the
entire United States, orthopedic injuries are still 27 times more common
than survivable strokes, and you are still 94 times as likely to hurt
your back in sports as you are to die from a CVA even if you don’t
exercise. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>In reality, the difference is much
greater because athletes are far less likely than the general population
to have cerebrovascular problems they have not inherited. There are no
actual data for the rates of CVA in the weight room </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">because they occur so
infrequently as to be statistically
unmeasurable</span></span></span><span>. More people drown in 5-gallon
buckets each year than have had barbell training-related strokes since
the invention of barbells. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The spinal support provided by the
anterior thoraco-abdominal pressure is precisely why it is natural for
us to use the Valsalva when we lift or push. Fighter pilots perform the
Valsalva when they are subjected to high G-forces in acrobatic
maneuvers; the increased support maintains an open vascular column,
which supplies blood to the brain, so that consciousness can be salvaged
under momentary high-G conditions that would otherwise cause a blackout
due to a drop in blood supply to the brain. The same conditions exist
under a heavy bar; the back must be supported, and the increased blood
pressure provided by the Valsalva maneuver serves to maintain blood
supply to the brain when pumping that blood gets harder under a bar
weighing 405 pounds. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>What is most important is that no one
gets under 405 pounds and squats it without having trained enough to be
able to do so. The cardiovascular system adapts to resistance training,
just like all of the other tissues and systems in the body, and this
adaptation occurs as strength increases. Anyone who is capable of
squatting extremely heavy weights is adapted for it in all the necessary
ways. And no lifter has ever pulled 800 pounds off the floor while
exhaling. For any trainee – and certainly any athlete – it is
incalculably more likely that following the advice to “inhale on the way
down and exhale on the way up” will actually cause an orthopedic injury,
rather than prevent a stroke. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>In fact, it is a good practice to take
and hold the biggest breath you can before each rep of your heaviest
sets. Get in the habit of breathing correctly during your lighter sets
so that the pattern is well established by the time the weights get
heavy. The Valsalva maneuver will prevent far more problems than it has
the potential to cause. It is a necessary and important technique for
safety in the weight room.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Spotting the
Squat</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Spotters in the weight room can often be
more trouble than help. Inexperienced, inattentive, stupid spotters can
get you hurt. The squat and the bench press are the only two exercises
in this basic program that require spotters, and if they do it wrong,
it’s almost better to just take your chances without them. Almost.
Squats and benches can be dangerous when they’re heavy, so good spotters
become an important commodity at some point in everybody’s
training.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Weights used in the squat can be
sufficiently heavy and are in such a position that it is not safe for
one spotter to work alone. Any squat attempt or set of squats you are
uncertain you can do, or you’re even a little worried about, should be
spotted by two people.</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="bold"> The squat requires two
spotters.</span></span></span><span> They have to learn to watch each
other and work carefully together to minimize the effects inherent in
having two people apply force to the same object. The differential
loading caused by one spotter jerking the bar up while the other one
doesn’t is a potential wreck, and it has caused many back injuries. But
this situation can be managed by having spotters learn how to do it
correctly. Spotters should apply force to the bar in a balanced way,
coordinating their efforts to keep the bar as level as possible while
minimizing the chance of hurting themselves in the process (<a

</p>
<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure
2-56.</span></span></span><span> Spotting the squat requires attention,
teamwork, and some finesse. Spotters should assume their positions prior
to the start of the set. If the lifter misses the rep, the spotters use
both hands and the crook of one elbow to catch each end of the bar. This
effort must be balanced and coordinated, or the lifter gets uneven
de-loading of the bar and a possible torsion injury. Any lifter who
bails out of the missed rep and leaves the spotters holding the bar
needs to be beaten with a hammer.</span></span></span></p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>A one-person spot for a squat cannot be
safely accomplished. When one spotter stands behind the lifter, leaning
over with his arms wrapped around and under the lifter’s chest, this is
not only an embarrassing position but also a terribly ineffective and
unsafe one. After all, if the lifter is so ungracious as to drop the bar
off of his back, what will a single spotter do? Catch it in his elbows?
If you are the ungracious lifter, any help the spotter gives you from
this position will be applied to your chest with his hands, thus
altering your position at precisely the worst time it could be altered.
So put embarrassing, ineffective, and unsafe together, and you can see
why using a single spotter for the squat is always a bad idea (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_006.html#filepos251406"
class="calibre9">Figure 2-57</a>).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>In a </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">dire</span></span></span><span>
emergency, a spotter might be able to help by standing directly behind
you and pushing up on the bar with as even a hand position as can be
managed around your grip and bar placement (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_006.html#filepos251406"
class="calibre9">Figure 2-57</a>). This method will not work if the
weight is heavy or the miss is profound; in either case, everybody needs
to take care of himself by getting away from the bar as safely as
possible. In fact, some coaches teach their athletes to dump the bar off
their backs – when they’re using rubber bumper plates and no spotters –
in the event of a miss. You can’t hurt spotters this way, since there
aren’t any, and spotters can’t hurt you, either. But this action
requires practice, bumper plates, and the permission of the gym owner.
Don’t try it without being shown how by a good coach. </span></span></p>

spot. Single-person spotting of the squat is tricky. The purpose of the
spot is to take some of the weight off the rep so that it can be

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>But this is a completely avoidable
situation, one that indicates that either the wrong weight is on the bar
or there is not enough help in the weight room. Things should be changed
so that it does not happen again, because the potential for injury is
high. Either come prepared to squat weights that require spotters, by
having them with you, or change your training plans for that

</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Squatting inside a power rack is
sometimes necessary. If the weight room is not set up correctly – i.e.,
the surface of the platform against the power rack is not flush with the
inside floor of the rack so that you can walk the squat back across a
level surface, or if your rack lacks a floor – you will need to stay
inside the rack to avoid stepping down or over things with the bar on
your back. And if there are absolutely no spotters and it is squat day,
you might have to squat inside the rack with the pins set at the correct
height for the bar: low enough that a below-parallel squat doesn’t touch
them, and high enough that a missed rep doesn’t drive you into the
floor. </span></span></p>

<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Power racks should be designed 1) with a
heavy floor inside that can be made flush with an adjacent platform so
that most of the time, squats can be walked out; 2) with uprights built
using the correct depth dimensions so that people can squat inside the
rack; and 3) with the pin holes spaced at a 2½- to 3-inch interval so
that lifters can set the pins at the right heights for their personal
dimensions (a 4-inch or greater interval is not useful). Squatting
inside the rack as a matter of regular practice might be required
because of a poorly designed rack and platform, or if you train alone,
but when you’re squatting heavy in the normal gym environment, it
creates a potential risk for the spotters and their hands. For the
lifter, having the uprights visible peripherally might be distracting;
their presence might alter the bar path as the lifter tries to avoid
touching them. You can get accustomed to having them there, but
squatting outside the rack is preferable, since available spotters
remove the only reason to squat inside a rack in a properly equipped
weight room. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>“Squatting” in a Smith machine is an
oxymoron. A Smith machine is not a squat rack, no matter what the girls
at the front desk tell you. A squat cannot be performed on a Smith
machine any more than it can be performed in a small closet with a
hamster. Sorry. There is a gigantic difference between a machine that
makes the bar path vertical for you and a squat that is executed
correctly enough to have a vertical bar path. The job of keeping the bar
path vertical should be done by the muscles, skeleton, and nervous
system, not by grease fittings, rails, and floor
bolts.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>A leg press machine – the “Hip Sled” –
is even less useful to a lifter who is already strong enough to squat.
By restricting the movement of joints that normally adjust their
position during a squat, this device eliminates the expression of your
normal biomechanics. The leg press may be useful for geriatric trainees
or for special populations that cannot effectively use the squat as an
exercise. But it is particularly heinous for healthy younger people
because it allows the use of huge weights and therefore facilitates
unwarranted bragging by those who should be squatting. A 1000-pound leg
press is as irrelevant as a 500-pound quarter-squat.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Supportive apparel, such as squat suits,
squat briefs, power socks, bench press shirts, and other such items, is
designed to help powerlifters lift more weight at a meet where such
equipment is permitted. Powerlifting is an extremely technical sport due
to the use of this equipment, but it has no place in a program of
strength training for athletics and fitness. Remember:
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">lifting more
weight is not always the same thing as getting

<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Belts and
wraps</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Less obvious is the role of belts and
knee wraps. A properly designed and adjusted belt is useful as a safety
device when you’re squatting heavy weights. A belt protects the spine by
increasing the amount of pressure that can be applied to it by the
muscles that support it. The belt itself reinforces the “cylinder” of
the ab muscles around the spine. At the same time, the belt acts as a
proprioceptive cue for a harder abdominal muscle contraction: you can
actually squeeze harder with a belt on than you can without one, just as
you can push harder against a loaded barbell than you can against a
broomstick. This effect ultimately produces both stronger abs, due to
the stronger isometric contraction facilitated by the belt, and a
stronger squat, due to the heavier loads made possible by the more
stable spine. </span></span></p>
<p><br />

<p><br />
</p>
<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure
2-59.</span></span></span><span> Increased pressure against the spine is
necessary for the safety and efficiency of the lift. The belt
facilitates this increase by providing a platform for proprioceptive
feedback for increased abdominal muscle contraction. Pushing against the
resistance of the belt makes for a harder abdominal contraction. And the
volumetric containment it provides allows an increase in pressure in the
abdominal and thoracic cavities.</span></span></span></p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>A suit is different in that it actually
enables you to lift weights that are heavier than those you can lift
without the suit. With a suit, some of the kinetic energy of the
descending, bar-loaded, eccentric contraction is stored as elastic
energy in the suit material and in the compressed skin and muscle under
the suit. That energy is then made available to the lifter as he
rebounds up, so the suit is in fact an artificial aid. It has been
argued that the belt is too, but a belt does not function across a joint
going into a sequence of flexion, stretch reflex, and extension, like a
suit does. Spinal support and safety are necessary for our general
strength training purposes, while a squat 30% heavier than that which
can be done unaided is not. Leave the squat suit for later, when you’re
entered in the meet.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>A properly designed belt is the same
width, usually 4 inches, all the way around. Many millions of cheap,
junky belts have been produced with 2-inch buckles and fronts, and
either 4- or 6-inch backs. These belts were designed by someone who did
not understand how a belt works. For the belt to function correctly, it
must act around the complete circle, and there is no reason for it to be
wider in the back than in the front. Four inches is about the widest
belt that most people can get between their ribs and hips. If you’re
shorter, or short-waisted, you may need to find a 3-inch belt. Thickness
is important in that a very thick, laminated suede belt feels very good
under a big weight. Its almost complete lack of stretch makes for a
comfortable ride. Such belts are expensive, though, and any good
single-ply 4-inch leather belt with a good buckle will suffice. Even a
well-made Velcro belt is still better than no belt. </span></span></p>

They can be constructed in various ways, but useful belts are the same
width along their entire length. Belts that widen in the back are
designed by people who do not understand the function of a
belt.</span></span></span></p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>You may not need a belt at all for the
early part of your training career, and if your abs are strong and your
back is uninjured, you may prefer to never use one. Very heavy weights
have certainly been lifted without one. This is a judgment call, but it
is probably prudent to err on the side of safety if there is any
question at all about it or if you have previously injured your back.
When a belt is used, it should be used judiciously, possibly restricted
to the last warm-up set and the work sets. As a general rule, do not
introduce a new variable into the work set – if you’re going to wear a
belt in the work set, make sure you use it in the last warm-up set so
that your movement pattern will not be altered or your attention
diverted under the heaviest weight of the day.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Using the belt correctly is a matter of
practice. It must be worn in the right place at the right tightness to
be effective, and if it’s wrong, it can actually screw up the lift it’s
designed to support. Put it on around your natural waist (higher than
you wear your pants) at a comfortable tightness, take your squat stance,
and squat down into the bottom position. The belt will adjust to the
position it wants to settle into, the place where it functions most
effectively, and it will have done so before the weight is a factor. In
other words, don’t let this position adjustment take place at the bottom
of the first rep you need the belt for – do it in advance. Stand back up
and tighten the belt to the point at which it adds a little pressure to
the gut. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>There is a common misconception about
the use of a belt. Many people have heard that you push the “stomach”
out against the belt. Doing this, however, will usually result in spinal
flexion, the very thing we wear the belt to prevent from happening under
a load. Just put the belt on tight, forget it’s there, and use your abs
the way you would without it. The belt functions without your having to
actually “use” it, because the tightness it provides against the abs
causes them to work harder without your micromanagement of the
situation.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The right amount of tightness is a
matter of individual preference, but as a general rule, more experienced
lifters can wear a tighter belt than novices can. It is also quite
possible to have a belt on too tight. If you have to stretch up to get
the belt’s prong in that last hole, you will be less able to exert
pressure with your own abdominal musculature, since it must be
contracted to actually generate force. Try this once to see for
yourself; when you do, you’ll find that there is an optimum tension on
the belt, and that too tight is worse than too loose. You’ll eventually
find that your belt adjustment varies with your body weight, your
underlying clothing, and even your hydration level; if your belt is
designed with holes close enough together to allow for fine adjustment,
it will come in handy. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Contrary to the new conventional wisdom
regarding this, a belt will not prevent your trunk from getting and
staying strong. It is hard for the layperson – or for that matter, a
coach who lacks personal experience with very heavy squats – to
understand this, but there is not one single relaxed muscle group in the
entire human body under a 600-pound squat; this statement most
especially applies to the muscles that are busy stabilizing the spine.
It’s not as if your trunk muscles just go to sleep when you put on your
belt. What actually happens is that the abs contract harder against the
external resistance provided by the belt than they can without it, in
the same way that your arms can contract harder when you curl a barbell
than when you curl a broomstick. A belt does in fact help you safely
lift more weight than you would without one, since a tight back better
supports more weight when you’re squatting, and squatting more weight
allows you to do more work through the range of motion and thus get
stronger. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Knee wraps are another matter. When a
lifter uses tight wraps, the one-meter or longer heavy kind with the
various-colored stripes, he is doing so to lift more weight. The
mechanism is the same with wraps as with squat suits. In the absence of
an injury, knee wraps must be considered supportive gear and should not
be worn. But in the event of certain knee injuries, wraps can be very
helpful IF USED CORRECTLY. If you have an old ligament injury that has
healed as well as it’s going to, wraps are useful to add some
compression, and thus stability, to the knee. A light wrap adds just
enough circumferential pressure to the whole knee assembly to act almost
like an external joint capsule, as well as maintaining warmth and
providing proprioceptive input to the skin and superficial structures.
The caveat is this: if your wraps are so tight that they must be
loosened immediately after the set, then they are acting as aids and not
as support. If you can keep the wraps on for the whole workout without
cutting off circulation to your lower legs, the wraps are loose enough
to be considered as only supportive. </span></span></p>

<br />
</p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Some older lifters with older-lifter
knees find that wraps a little tighter than loose support wraps make
pain-free squatting possible. By adding more support to knees that have
aged ungracefully, wraps can make the difference between a productive
exercise and a source of irritation. The compression provided by
properly applied wraps seems to prevent some of the inflammation that
unwrapped older knees experience when the lifter is training the squat
heavy.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Some heavier powerlifting wraps are so
heavy that they cannot actually be used as loose support wraps; their
elastic is so heavy that when it is stretched into position over its
entire length, even applied loosely, it is too tight to leave on, and
therefore too tight to consider as just supportive. Lighter wraps are
available at most sporting goods stores, and they’re fine for our
purposes. Rubber and cloth knee sleeves can be used if warmth is the
primary objective.</span></span></p>

<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Shoes are the only piece of personal
equipment that you really need to own. It takes only one set of five in
a pair of squat shoes to demonstrate this convincingly to anybody who
has done more than one squat workout. A good pair of squat shoes adds
enough to the efficiency of the movement that the cost is easily
justified. For anywhere from $50 for a used pair to more than $200 for
the newest Adidas weightlifting shoes, a pair of proper shoes makes a
big difference in the way a squat feels. Powerlifting squat shoes have
relatively flat soles, and Olympic weightlifting shoes have a little
lift in the heel that makes it easier to get the knees forward just in
front of the toes. Your choice will depend on your squatting style and
your flexibility. Avoid shoes with heels higher than 1 inch because
these are difficult to use for pulls from the floor, using the
kinematics advocated here, and they produce the same problems as using a
2×4 under the heels. Most squat shoes have metatarsal straps to increase
lateral stability, provide some very important arch support, and suck
the foot back into the heel of the shoe to reduce intra-shoe movement.

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span

</span></span></span><span> Weightlifting shoes are the most important
personal equipment a lifter can own. They provide solid contact with the
floor and eliminate sole compressibility and the instability of squishy
footing. Get a pair. It will be the best money you spend on your
training gear.</span></span></span></p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The primary beneficial feature of a
squat shoe is its lack of heel compressibility. The drive out of the
bottom starts at the floor, where the feet start the kinetic chain. If
the contact between the feet and the floor is the squishy gel or air
cell of a running shoe, a percentage of the force of the drive will be
absorbed by the compression of the cell. This compression reduces power
transmission efficiency and foot stability. Unstable footing interferes
with the reproducibility of the movement pattern, rendering virtually
every squat a whole new experience and preventing the development of
good technique. Squatting in running shoes is like squatting on a bed.
Many people get away with it for years, but serious lifters invest in
squat shoes. They aren’t that expensive, especially compared to brand
new name-brand athletic shoes, and they make a huge difference in the
way a squat feels.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>We have spent a lot of time developing a
model of barbell training from the perspective of balance. Poorly
designed or incorrectly utilized footwear completely undermines your
application of this rather elegant model. Just buy the damn
shoes.</span></span></p>

class="bold"><span>Clothing</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>A brief word about clothing is in order.
It is best to squat in a T-shirt, as opposed to a tank top, because
T-shirts cover more skin than tanks do. Skin is slick when sweaty, and
slick is not good for keeping the bar in place. The shirt should be 100%
cotton or 50/50 poly/cotton, not all synthetic, because these high-tech
materials are always slick under the bar. Shorts, sweats, or training
pants should always be made of stretchy material. This is very important
because if your pants grab your legs, and they will because of the
sweat, a non-stretch garment will restrict the movement of your legs and
interfere with your ability to shove your knees out and use your hips.
The same thing is true for shorts that stop right below the knee, even
if they are stretchy. Mid-thigh stretchy shorts or simple gray sweats
are the best pants for training. And make sure your pants are pulled up;
if the crotch hangs down in the middle of your thighs, this will
interfere with your knee position. Clothing should not affect your
movement in any way and should never, ever make it harder for you to do
a thing that is hard already – squat correctly.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span

</span></span></span><span> Training clothes should fit in a way that
does not hinder the performance of the lifts or the ability of a coach
to observe your technique. Baggy pants and shirts may be fashionable,
but they are not terribly useful in the weight room. T-shirts are
preferred over tank tops, and shorts and sweats should be chosen for
function, not appearance. But clever logos are always
good.</span></span></span></p>

<br />
</p>
<p><span class="calibre5"><span
class="bold"><span>Mirrors</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Squatting in front of a mirror is a
really bad idea. Many weight rooms have mirrors on the walls and have
conveniently placed the squat racks near the walls, too, making it
impossible to squat without a mirror in front of you. A mirror is a bad
tool because it provides information about only one plane of the three:
the frontal, the one that gives you the least information about your
position and your balance. Forward and backward movement is extremely
difficult to detect when you’re looking straight forward into a mirror.
Depth is also very difficult to judge from this direction; some
obliqueness of angle is required to see the relationship between the
patella and the hip, but a mirror set at an oblique angle would require
that the neck be twisted a little under the load to see it. Cervical
rotation under a heavy bar is as bad an idea as cervical overextension
under a heavy bar.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>A mirror can also be distracting because
it shows any movements occurring in what should be your invisible,
uncluttered background when you’re looking down. The human brain being
quite sensitive to visual movement, this is not useful when you’re
trying to concentrate on squatting a heavy weight and some Bozo looking
at his massive biceps walks behind you during the set.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The most important reason to squat
without a mirror in front of you is that you should be developing your
kinesthetic sense while you squat. When you pay attention to all of the
proprioceptive input provided by focusing on your balance point on the
floor in front of you, the pressure on your feet, the feel of your back
angle, the bar in your hands and against your back, and your general
sense of the balance of the movement, your sensory input is much richer
than that provided visually by the mirror image. Learn to feel the
correct position, not to merely see it.</span></span></p>

</div>
<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Coaching
Cues</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>One more thought: Throughout this book,
the term “cue” will be used. A </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">cue</span></span></span><span> is
a movement signal, and it is an important concept in sports pedagogy.
Cues are used both by coaches with the athletes they are handling and by
athletes for themselves. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>For a coach, a cue is a signal that
causess the athlete to correct some part of the movement he is about to
do, as previously discussed with the coach. It has been built into the
athlete's understanding of the movement during the process of learning
it with the coach. The cue focuses the athlete’s attention on the thing
he should be thinking about at that time, instead of all the other
things he is probably thinking about. A cue is not a long, detailed
explanation that introduces a brand new concept just before the lifter
performs a PR (personal record) attempt. Rather, a cue is a word or two,
maybe three, seldom four, that </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">reminds</span></span></span><span> but does not explain.
A cue should not have to be processed much by the mind that receives it;
it should be heard by the ear and sent on down to the place that was
waiting for it to trigger the action to which it refers.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>An example of a cue is “chest up.” In
contrast, “lift the chest so that your back gets flat” is not a cue. The
former can be used after the lifter has assumed the starting position,
right before he starts the pull. The latter must be used well before he
assumes the starting position, when he can give some thought to what he
is about to do. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Cues are worked out between the athlete
and the coach during training. Cues evolve naturally as the two people
communicate with each other about the movement. A coach will develop his
favorite ways of explaining key concepts to his athletes over his
coaching career. He will tailor these explanations to fit the needs of
the individuals he is working with, and cues will develop. Some cues,
like “chest up,” are almost universal due to their usefulness, brevity,
and sound. They almost bark the correct position at the athlete. Other
cues, which appear to be so non-specific as to be useless (like “Now!”),
are in fact specific to a thing decided upon between coach and lifter
and are extremely individual to that particular situation. Cues must be
given in the right circumstances and at exactly the right time, or they
do not trigger anything useful.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>A cue can also be a reminder that you
give yourself. It will not necessarily be spoken aloud, although this
sometimes helps. It will be the same thing that a coach would say to you
under the same circumstances, a reminder of a position problem that you
have already worked out but that you need to pay attention to just
before doing the movement. As you learn the exercises covered in this
book, you should develop your own set of cues that will serve to
reinforce good form. As you become more experienced, you will find it
necessary to build cues into your approach to each lift, to solve your
own individual problems with each movement pattern. You will find that
each lift responds to its own reminder, and if you train alone, you’ll
have to remind yourself.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>You will find that there are two basic
types of cues: body cues and bar cues. </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">Body
cues</span></span></span><span> are references to parts of your body
interacting with the bar, like “chest up,” “look forward,” or “long,
straight arms.” These cues draw awareness to the thing doing the moving:
the muscles or body part needing a correction. In contrast,
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">bar
cues</span></span></span><span> refer to the object being moved. For
instance, if your problem is jerking yourself out of position while
coming off the floor in a deadlift, a problem that usually happens when
you’re in a hurry to get the bar moving fast, the bar cue might be “pull
it slow” or “squeeze it up.”</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>As a general rule, body cues draw the
lifter’s attention to a component of the movement, while a bar cue
refers to the whole movement or to a part of it that several components
are engaged in. “Straight elbows” may fix a problem by calling attention
to the specific problem addressed. In contrast, “Keep the bar vertical”
describes a complicated process of adjusting the three diagnostic
angles, which the lifter can easily do by visualizing one simple thing.
A bar cue generally means that if you do certain things to the bar
correctly, your body will solve the problem. Some people process bar
cues better than body cues, and what works for one exercise might not
work for another. Deciding which cues to use is just one of the skills
that you will develop through experience. </span></span></p>

Press</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">

<hr />
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The press is the oldest upper-body
exercise done with a barbell. The day the barbell was invented, the guy
who invented it figured out a way to pick it up and shove it over his
head. After all, it is the logical thing to do with a barbell. Equipment
has changed quite a bit over the past hundred or so years. We now have
barbells that load with plates, racks we can set our bars in and adjust
to various heights so that we don’t always have to clean the weight to
our shoulders first, and even plates made out of rubber in case we need
to drop the weight. But pressing the barbell overhead is still the most
useful upper-body exercise in the weight room.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Prior to the rise of bodybuilding, the
standard test of upper-body strength was the press or, more correctly,
the </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">two-hands
press</span></span></span><span>. The popularity of the bench press has
changed this to the detriment of athletes and lifters who never obtain
the benefits of the press, which is the more balanced exercise. Bench
pressing, a contest lift in powerlifting, actually became popular among
bodybuilders first, when large pectorals (“pecs,” or maybe “chesticles”)
became the fashion in physique contests, starting in the 1950s.
Powerlifting incorporated the bench press as a standard contest lift in
the mid-1960s, thus diminishing the importance of the overhead version
of the press among those training primarily for strength. The final nail
in the coffin was the elimination of the clean and press from Olympic
weightlifting competition after the 1972 Olympics. This unfortunate
development changed the nature of Olympic weightlifting training,
effectively removing upper-body strength training from the list of
exercises perceived as necessary by most weightlifting coaches. The
exercise has continued its decline in both popularity and familiarity,
to the extent that today you are quite likely to hear a seated
behind-the-neck press described as a “military press” by the personal
trainers in big-box gyms. </span></span></p>

<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>So, a terminology lesson is in order. A
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">press
</span></span></span><span>refers to a movement performed while
standing, whereby a weight is extended to arms’ length overhead with the
use of the shoulders and arms only. If a barbell is used, the exercise
is properly a </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">two-hands press</span></span></span><span>, although it
is understood that the unqualified term “press” refers to a barbell
press done with both hands (since lifting a barbell one-handed is not
the normal use of the equipment). Any deviation from this description
warrants a qualifier. A </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">seated press</span></span></span><span> is a barbell
press done in a seated position – an exercise that requires a special
bench, unless the lifter is capable of cleaning the weight and sitting
down with it on his shoulders, and then lowering it to the floor after
the set. This restriction limits the amount of weight that can be
lifted, and thus the ultimate usefulness of the exercise. A
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">dumbbell
press</span></span></span><span> is a standing simultaneous two-hands
movement, unless the alternated or one-hand version is specified. Any
press performed supine on a bench is a </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">bench
press</span></span></span><span>, the barbell being understood as the
equipment unless a </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">dumbbell bench press</span></span></span><span> is
specified. If the barbell is used behind the neck, this position is part
of the name. “Military press” refers to the strictest form of the
exercise. A </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">military press</span></span></span><span> is performed
without any bend of the hips or back used to start the weight, sometimes
with the heels together. A </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">behind-the-neck press</span></span></span><span> is a
harder movement than a press; still harder is a </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">seated behind-the-neck
press</span></span></span><span>. The use of the flexed and extended
knees as an aid in starting the bar off the shoulders means that a
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">push
press</span></span></span><span> has been performed.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>One of the reasons the press was
eliminated from Olympic weightlifting was the difficulty most judges had
in bringing themselves to red-light an excessively weird press. Referred
to by the term “Olympic press,” the form of this movement that developed
over the last few years of its presence in the meet was such that the
bar was driven up from the shoulders by the use of a combination of a
sharp hip flexion from overextension and a shrug of the traps. Some very
adept practitioners could lean back to a point almost equivalent to a
bench press, rendering the description of the lift as a “press from the
shoulders” rather inaccurate. An inexperienced or unconditioned lifter
attempting this movement ran the risk of a spinal hyperextension injury,
although such injuries were not that common: experienced, conditioned
lifters had very strong abs. </span></span></p>

</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre26"> Tommy Suggs
demonstrates a moderate amount of layback in this 1968 National
Championships photo. The press was eliminated from Olympic competition
due to “judging difficulties” – a reluctance on the part of the
international governing body to establish and enforce adequate criteria
about layback. It is likely that the press was actually eliminated due
to a desire to shorten the meet and to avoid the political complications
that arose from the lack of uniformly applied judging
standards.</span></span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The press is the most useful upper-body
exercise for sports conditioning, primarily because it is not just an
upper-body exercise. Except for powerlifting and swimming, all sports
that require the use of upper-body strength transmit that force along a
kinetic chain that starts at the ground. Any time an athlete pushes
against an opponent, throws an implement, uses a racquet or club on a
ball, or transmits force to an object, that force starts at the feet
against the ground. In a press, the </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">kinetic
chain</span></span></span><span> – the components of the musculoskeletal
system involved in the production and transmission of force between the
base of support and the load being moved – starts at the ground and ends
at the bar in the hands. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The kinetic chain in a bench press, in
contrast, begins at the point on the bench where the upper back contacts
it directly under the bar, and ends at the bar in the hands. Proficient
bench pressers involve their legs all the way down to the ground, using
their lower body as a brace for the kinetic chain. But this does not
mean that the kinetic chain extends to the ground, since the bench press
can be performed with the feet on the bench or even up in the air. As in
the squat, where the hands are an important component of the exercise
but do not actually move the bar, the lower body is an important part of
the bench press without actually being part of the kinetic chain. Even a
very proficient bench presser, using the trunk and legs as efficiently
as possible, is still pushing against a bench, not balancing the load
with his feet and not using his entire body against the ground as he
presses. For the press, using the whole body as the kinetic chain is
inherent in the movement.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Basic bench press performance is
different from the press in that it is primarily an upper-body exercise.
It is an unusual thing in sports to actually place the back against an
immovable object and use it to push against something else; it happens
after the play is dead in American football if you’re under the pile,
but not in many other situations. The press involves the entire body,
down to the feet against the floor, using all of the trunk musculature
(the abs and back muscles) and the hips, legs, ankles, wrists, and feet
to stabilize the body while the shoulders, upper chest, and arms press
the bar overhead. This kinetic chain, from overhead at full arms’ length
down to the floor, is the longest possible one for the human body. And
this makes the press an excellent tool for training your stability under
a load.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Another difference lies in the basic
nature of the movement pattern and its use of the muscle contraction.
The bench press starts from the top down, with an eccentric contraction,
and thus has the advantage of a stretch reflex out of the bottom to
assist the concentric contraction, the up phase of the lift. In
contrast, the press, like the deadlift, starts the drive up (in this
case, from the shoulders) with the bar at rest; the hardest part of the
movement is the first part. A multi-rep set can be modified so that the
reps after the first one can start at the top – you drop down and
rebound up out of the bottom position, utilizing a stretch reflex, and
breathe at the top, as you do in a bench press or a squat. But the basic
movement, the one done with the heaviest weights, starts at the
shoulders from a dead stop.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>For an exercise to be useful as a
conditioning tool for a sport, it must utilize the same muscles and the
same type of neurological activation pattern as that sport.
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">It need not be
an identical copy of the sport movement.</span></span></span><span> In
fact, it has been demonstrated that if the motor pathway of a slower
conditioning exercise is too similar to that of the faster sport skill –
as in throwing a weighted basketball – interference with correct skill
execution can result. You would, in effect, be practicing throwing the
ball slower than you actually throw it. And since you don’t throw
objects of different weights exactly the same way, you’d also get to
practice throwing it slightly wrong. Effective strength training for a
sport should incorporate all the muscles involved in the sport in a
coordinated way, so that strength is produced in the generalized
patterns of movement used in barbell training –</span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic"> and specific to nothing
else</span></span></span><span>. Then, sports practice incorporates the
newly acquired strength as it develops. A sport such as football
requires the use of all the muscles in the body because force is
generated against the ground by the hips and legs, transmitted up the
trunk, and applied to the opponent through the arms and shoulders.
Presses, squats, deadlifts, bench presses, and power cleans develop that
strength through progressive </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">training</span></span></span><span>, and as the athlete
gets stronger, football </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">practice</span></span></span><span> precisely applies the
strength in the actual pattern of its use.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Specifically for the press, it is
important to understand that the force is not produced solely and
independently by the upper body. The shoulders and arms participate in
the production of force, but they are completely dependent on the hips
and legs to react against the ground through the feet as they work. In
football, the kinetic chain begins at the ground because the feet move
first; in pressing, it begins at the bar. Both movements transfer force
along this kinetic chain through the trunk, and its isometric function
is the same in both. The press provides the pattern of kinetic
similarity required of a useful, applicable exercise (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_007.html#filepos299461"
class="calibre9">Figure 3-3</a>). The bench press does not, but it does
allow the use of heavier weights. We will do them both in this program,
but we must realize the strengths and limitations of each exercise.

</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre26"> A comparison of the
kinetic-chain vectors of the press, typical football activity, and the
bench press. Note that in the lineman’s effort, force is being applied
both vertically and horizontally. The press strongly develops the
athlete’s ability to push through a range of directions while driving
from the ground. The bench press is more limited in the applicability of
the strength it produces, although it allows the use of heavier
weights.</span></span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>As a general rule, the more of the body
involved in an exercise, the better the exercise. The press produces
strength in the trunk muscles – the abs, obliques, costals, and back –
as well as in the shoulders and arms. It trains the whole body to
balance while standing and pressing with a heavy weight in the hands and
overhead. It uses more muscles and more central nervous system activity
than any other upper-body exercise. And it produces force in a more
useful direction than does the bench press, in which force is directed
at about 90 degrees away from the trunk. In football, the arms are
usually used at an angle well above 90 degrees. The press, producing
force vertically overhead, is not an exact match, but it is much closer
to a useful direction than the bench press is. More important, if
football players put their backs against solid objects positioned at an
inclined angle and pushed against them, the incline bench press would be
a pretty good exercise. They don’t. Programs that have switched to the
incline because of the supposedly improved carryover ignore the
important kinetic-chain element of the press that makes it such an
important exercise. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>It is in fact possible to press a lot
more weight while lying on the bench than while standing with the bar in
the hands. So for simple upper-body strength, the bench press is the
better exercise. Doing both exercises enables the strength developed
from the bench press to be applied in a more useful way for sports.
Athletes who never do anything but bench press tend to have more
shoulder problems than those who include overhead training. With all the
pressing emphasis directed to the anterior side of the shoulders, the
posterior side gets relatively weak. Since it is possible to bench very
heavy weights with years of training, this strength imbalance can be
very pronounced. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The posterior shoulder musculature
includes the very important rotator cuff group of external rotators, the
muscles responsible for decelerating internal humeral rotation during
throwing movements (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_007.html#filepos304027"
class="calibre9">Figure 3-4</a>). The rotator cuff basically consists of
the muscles on the anterior and posterior sides of the shoulder blade.
The subscapularis covers the front of the scapula between it and the rib
cage, and functions as an internal rotator. The supraspinatus, the
infraspinatus, and the teres minor attach various points on the
posterior scapula to the humerus, and provide for its external rotation
as well as deceleration of internal rotation (as when a thrown ball is
released). In a press, they do not work directly as the primary muscles
producing the movement, but they are used as stabilizers and are
therefore strengthened in this capacity. In contrast, the bench press
does not work the external rotators much, certainly not much in
comparison to the loads being handled by the pectorals and anterior
deltoids, which function as the main internal rotators of the humerus.
If the internal rotators become disproportionately strong, enough to
exceed the capacity of the external rotators to decelerate the humerus
during a throw, injuries can and often do occur. </span></span></p>

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>An injury usually attributed to the
press by physical therapists and other medical types is the situation
called </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">shoulder impingement</span></span></span><span>. Most of
the time, PTs advise against using the press because of the supposed
tendency of the tendons of the rotator cuff muscles to become trapped
between the head of the humerus and the bony projections on the scapula
− the coracoid and acromion processes. These bony knobs function as
attachment points for the biceps, the pec minor, the coracobrachialis
muscle, and the ligaments that hold the scapula and the clavicle
together at the acromioclavicular (AC) joint. The coracoid and acromion
processes overhang the head of the humerus where it articulates with the
glenoid. Because the external rotators, specifically the supraspinatus
and the infraspinatus, overlay the head of the humerus and underlay the
subacromial bursa and these bony knobs, most PTs believe that the
potential for mashing the bones together and trapping the tendons in
between (impinging the tendons) is so high that the exercise is
dangerous and should not be performed.</span></span></p>

relationship of the traps, the scapulae, the arms, and the bar in the
press.</span></span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>This dogma ignores the anatomical facts
about a properly performed press. The scapula is attached to the rest of
the shoulder girdle at only one point, the clavicle at the AC joint.
Except for the acromioclavicular ligament, the scapula essentially
“floats” freely through its range of motion in a sheath of fascia and
muscle, so that its position can change relative to all the other
structures of the back and the humerus. The scapula can move from a
position of extreme adduction, as in the bench press, to being pulled
forward, as with the start position of a <a
href="#filepos1027333"
class="calibre9">barbell row</a>, to the shrugged-up,
rotated-in-at-the-top position used at the top of the
press.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>When you press overhead, you finish the
movement by shrugging your shoulders up toward the bar. This motion
engages the trapezius muscles that connect the spinous processes of the
vertebral segments in the neck and upper back to the scapulas, and this
actively reinforces the traps’ support for the shoulders and the bar. In
effect, the bar is supported overhead by the locked-in-line arms, the
scapulas hold up the arms, and the traps hold up the scapulas, so the
shrugged traps actively support the weight of the bar. When the traps
contract, they pull the scapulas together at the top so that they rotate
medially, and the shrug pulls them upward. This motion points the
glenoid cavity upward to directly support the humerus from below, and
pulls the acromion and coracoid processes </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">away</span></span></span><span>
from the humerus. If you press properly, the shrugged-upward scapulas
are thus positioned to support the arms and the bar overhead while
making impingement of the cuff tendons impossible (<a

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The claim that presses impinge the
shoulder is therefore not correct. Pressing </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">incorrectly</span></span></span><span> is not the same
thing as pressing – you don’t get to redefine the exercise and then
claim that it’s dangerous. Driving a car is dangerous if you drive it
into a great big rock.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>There are several excellent ways to
impinge the shoulder, none of them involving the press. All you have to
do is hold the scapula in position while letting the humerus wedge
itself into the bony processes. Bench pressing with an incorrect elbow
position and certain gymnastic movements, like ring dips and ring
pushups in the absence of adequate strength preparation, are good ways
to put the shoulder in an anatomically or mechanically dangerous
situation that you cannot control. Powerlifting is hard on the
shoulders’ long-term health, and the recent fascination with gymnastic
exercises by novice athletes has been responsible for many surgical
procedures that would otherwise not have been necessary. Sports that use
an overhead position, like tennis, swimming, and volleyball, but which
do not typically use the press to prepare the body for the stress of
that position, experience high rates of shoulder injury and surgical
repair. But amazingly enough, shoulder injuries are quite uncommon in
Olympic weightlifting, where the point of the sport is to put as much
weight overhead as possible. Weightlifters learn very quickly how to
hold a weight overhead, while tennis players have perhaps been actively
discouraged from learning the safe way to work in this
position.</span></span></p>

<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Shoulder injuries do occur with
significant frequency, and the press has been used for decades to
rehabilitate injured shoulders, particularly injured rotator cuffs.
Rehabbing this way works for the same reason that it is safe to press,
and for the same reason that pressing actually strengthens the rotator
cuff muscles. Physical Therapy usually addresses shoulder rehab with
direct exercises on the rotator cuff involving rubber bands and 2-pound
dumbbells, an interesting approach considering that these isolation
movements do not occur as a normal part of typical human movement
patterns. But when you press overhead and finish the lockout correctly,
all of the muscles of the shoulder are tight and contracted. As the
weight goes up over time, the strength of the finish must increase and
the force produced by all of the contracting muscles must therefore
increase as well. Since the press uses the rotator cuff muscles
isometrically to stabilize the lockout position at the top, and since
proper form ensures that they are active in this capacity
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">as well as
safe relative to a position of impingement</span></span></span><span>,
it seems as though the logical way to strengthen the cuff muscles – even
cuff muscles weakened by injury and surgical repair – is to press
correctly. In the correct press lockout, the weaker muscles are
supported by the healthy ones, and as the injured muscles heal, they are
able to resume an increasing amount of their normal functional load
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">if</span></span></span><span> correct technique is
utilized with weights light enough to permit it. In this way, the
injured muscles can be brought back to normal function
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">while
performing</span></span></span><span> their normal function, in effect
given no choice but to heal by doing what they normally
do.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Since the press strengthens the
shoulders, the key to shoulder health for your whole athletic career and
your life as an active adult is to press correctly as an integral part
of your training. Most lifters who have shoulder problems have failed to
take this advice and have paid for ignoring this most important
upper-body exercise. In fact, before the bench press became the sole
focus of upper-body training in the gym, shoulder injuries were
uncommon. Rotator cuff problems can be addressed in training, before
they ever start, by making sure that bench press work is balanced by an
equivalent amount of overhead work. For every bench press workout, there
should be a press workout. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The surprising thing about the press is
that it is very technically demanding. It is a very hard lift to do with
a lot of weight, and most people work for many years to develop their
ability to do it well. We’d better get started.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The press starts at the rack with the
empty bar. It should be set at the same height as for the squat, at
about the middle of the sternum. If you are a female, a younger trainee,
or an older or injured person, be aware that a 45-pound bar may be too
heavy to start with on this exercise. Take steps to ensure that the
proper equipment is available, or you will never have a chance to learn
the exercise properly.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The grip for the press is determined by
the simple mechanics we already know. The width is such that it places
the forearms in a vertical position as seen from the back or front (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_007.html#filepos316139"
class="calibre9">Figure 3-8</a>). This grip places your index fingers
somewhere between the edge of the knurl and a half-inch out from the
knurl.<br />

<br />
<br />
There are exceptionally large people who need a wider grip to keep the
forearms vertical, but not many. Too wide a grip creates moment arms
between the grip position on the bar and the elbows, between the elbows
and the shoulders, and between the grip and the shoulders; and these
moment arms are leverage you will have to overcome that need not be
there at all (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_007.html#filepos317531"
class="calibre9">Figure 3-9</a>). The choice of equipment may not be up
to you here, and most people will need to work with what they have, so
note that a standard Olympic weightlifting bar has about 16.5 inches (42
cm) of space between the knurls (there is no standard center marking for
a powerlifting bar, but most are close to this). It might make things
easier if you mark your oddball bar to this standard so that you can use
the same grip width every time.<br />

<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The grip should position the bones of
the forearm directly under the bar, to eliminate any leverage produced
against the wrist from having the bar too far back in the hand. The best
way to position the grip efficiently is to set the grip width at your
index fingers, and then rotate your hands into pronation by pointing
your thumbs down toward your feet. This setup aligns the bar with the
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">radial
longitudinal crease</span></span></span><span> and between the
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">thenar

thumb) and the medial palmar (</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">hypothenar</span></span></span><span>) eminence on the
other side – parallel to your “life-line,” to use a more familiar term.
Then, just lay your fingers down on the bar and squeeze the fingertips
into the bar. When you take it out of the rack, the bar will be on the
heel of your palm and directly over your forearm bones, as shown in <a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_007.html#filepos320882"
class="calibre9">Figure 3-10</a>. The thumbless grip is never used when
pressing, not because of the danger – which is obviously not there when
the bar can be dropped to the floor. Rather, the thumbs-around grip
permits the “squeeze” in the forearms that increases the tightness of
the muscles, making the drive from the start position more efficient and
increasing motor unit recruitment throughout the arms and upper body.
Except for the squat, </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span

<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Take the bar out of the rack – the EMPTY
BAR, at the correct weight for your ability. Your grip will have placed
the bar on the heel of your palms, and your elbows should now move to a
position just in front of the bar when viewed from the side. This
placement creates a vertical position for the radius bone of the
forearm. (Most people place the elbows under or behind the bar,
positions that tend to make the bar drive away from the body when you
press.) Shrug your shoulders up and forward just a little; the idea is
to have the bar resting on top of your anterior deltoids, the meaty part
of your shoulders, at the start of the movement. </span></span></p>

<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Inflexible people may not be able to get
the shoulders far enough forward and up to put the bar in this position
at first; if flexibility is the problem, you will quickly stretch out.
Some people have long forearms relative to the length of their upper
arms, and this anthropometry makes getting the bar on the deltoids
impossible with the elbows in the correct position and a narrow grip.
Sitting on the delts is the ideal position for the bar, but the movement
can be done from a less-than-perfect position without any real problem.
Very flexible people should make sure not to raise the elbows too high;
doing so pulls the scapulae forward and produces a lack of tightness and
stability across the shoulder blades that is not conducive to an
efficient press. </span></span></p>

<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Your stance in the press is not as
precisely critical as it is in the squat. Take a comfortable stance, and
you will usually end up with something that will work. Your squat stance
actually works well for the press. Too close a stance creates a balance
problem, and much farther apart than the squat stance feels pretty
weird. We will not be using a ground reaction in this lift (since it is
not a push press), so don’t worry about trying to simulate a vertical
jump stance for this lift. In fact, when in doubt, go a little
wider.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Many initial position problems can be
prevented with a correct positioning of the eyes. Look straight ahead to
a point on the wall that is level with your eyes. (This assumes that you
are in a facility with walls. If the walls are too far away, a piece of
equipment will do.) Stare at that point for the whole set. You might
need to give yourself a point to look at. If you need to, draw a big dot
on a sheet of paper and hang it up at the point that causes your eyes to
hold the correct position. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Now lift your chest. This is actually
accomplished by placing the upper part of the erector spinae in
contraction. Think about lifting your sternum up to your chin or showing
off your boobs. (Sorry for the coarse analogy, but you’ll have to admit
that it’s useful.) Refer to <a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_007.html#filepos326709"
class="calibre9">Figure 3-13</a> for this position. “Chest up” is really
a back contraction, and the press and the front squat are the two best
exercises for strengthening and developing control of these muscles.
Lifting your chest produces tightness in the upper back and in the
entire kinetic chain, making your connection to the ground more stable
and improving your pressing mechanics overall.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>When your elbows are up correctly and
you have lifted your chest, you are ready to press the bar. The press is
learned in two stages: First, you will put the bar where it is going to
be in the finished position. This step consists of learning the lockout
position and the anatomical and mechanical reasons for using it. Second,
you will learn how to get the bar there correctly. This step consists of
learning how to produce a mechanically efficient bar path and how to use
your whole body to do it.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="bold">Step 1:</span></span></span><span> Take a big breath, hold
it (our friend the Valsalva maneuver), and drive the bar up over your
head. The vast majority of people will press the bar up to lockout but
in a position just in front of the forehead. Make sure that you have the
bar directly above the back of your neck, a point that should have the
bar, the glenohumeral joint, and the mid-foot in a straight vertical
line (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_007.html#filepos329217"
class="calibre9">Figure 3-14</a>). This is the position in which there
is minimal leverage operating against the primary segments of the
kinetic chain – the bar to the shoulder, and the shoulder down to the
mid-foot. If the bar is directly plumb to the shoulder joints, the load
applies no leverage to the shoulders. If the shoulders are plumb to the
mid-foot, the back and legs apply no leverage to the balance point. If
the bar is plumb to the mid-foot, the entire kinetic chain is in simple
compression, with no leverage against the primary
segments.</span></span></p>

<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Once the bar is over your head
correctly, lock your elbows and shrug up your shoulders to support the
bar. The bones of the arm are lined up in a column by the triceps and
deltoids; the shoulders are shrugged up with the trapezius; and the arms
and the traps must work together to support heavy weights overhead.
Imagine someone behind you gently pushing your elbows together and
pulling them up at the same time, as illustrated in <a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_007.html#filepos331099"
class="calibre9">Figure 3-15</a>. The combination of locking the elbows
out and shrugging the traps up at lockout, with the bar directly over
the ears, produces a very firm, stable position at the top that involves
all of the shoulder-girdle muscles and prevents shoulder impingement.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>It is helpful to think about the lockout
as a continuation of the upward drive, as though you are never finished
pressing the bar upward. When the load is heavy, this cue provides the
last little push necessary to get the bar into the lockout position.
Think about pressing the bar up to the ceiling.</span></span></p>

bar is back in a position over the shoulder joints, a point that will be
well behind the forehead if the neck is in the normal anatomical
position. You might find it helpful to think of the bar being pulled
back into this position from behind. (B) The bar is then supported in
this position with the triceps, deltoids, and traps. To learn this
position, you might find it helpful to feel a gentle upward and inward
squeeze on the humerus from either side, along with hearing a reminder
to “shrug” the bar up.</span></span></span></p>

<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="bold">Step 2:</span></span></span><span> After this lockout
position is correct, it is time to learn how to best drive the bar to
this position. This step involves making the bar path correct and
establishing the proper movement of your body in relation to the bar.
Since the bar is sitting on your deltoids, in front of the neck, and it
must move up to a position above the shoulder joints, several inches
behind the starting position, there must be a relative lateral movement
of several inches on the way up (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_007.html#filepos333133"
class="calibre9">Figure 3-16</a>). But barbells like to travel in
straight vertical lines up and down, especially when they’re heavy. Our
vertical bar path must therefore be produced in a way that takes the
load from a position in front of the shoulders to the lockout position
plumb to the shoulder joints. We do this with motion of the
torso.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Lean back slightly by pushing your hips
forward. This slight movement must not be produced by bending the knees
or the lumbar spine. Rather, the movement is a function of only the
hips. Without the bar and with your hands on your hips, push your pelvis
forward and back a few times, keeping your knees and your low back
locked in position. Try to do this rocking motion with just your hip
joints. When the weight gets heavy, your abs will lock your low back and
your quads will lock your knees, involving both of these muscle masses
in the exercise isometrically. It’s easy unweighted, but later it
becomes a huge part of this challenging exercise (<a

find that the forward torso movement contributes to lockout at the top:

the upper arm and the forearm into alignment, thus driving up the bar.

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>To further reinforce the vertical bar
path, think about keeping the bar close to your face on the way up. Aim
for your nose as the bar leaves your shoulders. Then, as you lower the
bar for the next rep, aim for your nose on the way down as well. You may
actually hit yourself in the nose before you figure this out, but you’ll
probably do it just once. By establishing a bar path close to your face
on both the concentric and eccentric halves of the movement, you
practice it starting from the very first sets of the
exercise.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>After as much practice with the empty

Corrections</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>There won’t be nearly as many problems
with the press as there are with the squat or deadlift, because there
are fewer joints actively participating in the movement of the bar. Most
problems are either starting position problems or bar path problems, and
they result in a missed press for really just two
reasons:</span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<ul>
<li><span>You fail to get the bar off your chest.</span></li>
<li><span>The distance between the shoulder and the bar becomes too long

</ul>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The first problem happens because you
have lost your </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">tightness</span></span></span><span> in the start
position due to breathing errors, positioning errors (chest not up,
elbows not up, etc.), or a focus error or because you have just gotten
tired or the weight is too heavy. The second problem occurs because you
have produced </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">an incorrect bar path</span></span></span><span>. You
pushed the bar forward instead of up, you failed to hold your position
under the bar as you pushed it up, or you failed to get back under the
bar after it crossed your forehead. Let’s look at the conditions under
which these errors occur and figure out how to prevent
them.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Losing
tightness</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>There are two types of upper back
looseness that commonly screw up the press. The first type, caused by
letting the chest cave in so that the upper back rounds, is very common.
Heavy weight on a press is uncomfortable enough already, without your
exacerbating the problem with a lack of good support. Keeping the chest
up holds the thoracic spine in proper anatomical position, and this is
primarily accomplished with the upper back muscles and your breathing
pattern. When the upper erector spinae muscles contract, they rotate the
rib cage up, holding it in place against the load on the shoulders.
Remembering to “lift the chest” is usually all that is required, but
most people will need to really focus on this in every rep for a while.
The attention span can be short under a bar, especially a heavy bar on
the front of the shoulders, and focusing on technique gets more
difficult as the weight gets heavier. A big held breath – the same
Valsalva maneuver that is used for all barbell exercises – is your
friend during the press. Air is support, in this case for the rib cage
as well as for the spine, and the act of tightening and lifting the
chest is so enmeshed in the action of taking a big breath under a heavy
load that the two are essentially inseparable. They happen at the same
time and they signal each other to happen. </span></span></p>

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure
3-20.</span></span></span><span> Lifting the chest is primarily a
function of the upper back muscles.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>You will have to take a new breath
before each rep, at least for a while, or you risk a “blackout” at
heavier weights. </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">Vasovagal syncope</span></span></span><span> is the term
applied to a blackout or fainting. It can be caused by a
sympathetic/parasympathetic nervous system response to 1) pressure on
the neck from the bar, 2) the shrugged lockout position, and/or 3) the
general effects of the anterior bar position’s load on the vascular
structure in the neck that is known as the </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">carotid
sinus.</span></span></span><span> Pressure applied to the carotid sinus
by any of these three mechanisms can produce a blackout in susceptible
people by reducing the heart rate at exactly the wrong time
(interestingly enough, this seldom happens in women). The phenomenon is
not directly related to the Valsalva itself because a loaded Valsalva is
not a problem for healthy people in the squat, bench press, or deadlift,
in which the loaded Valsalva results in </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">increased</span></span></span><span> blood flow to the
brain. The chances of a blackout happening increases markedly if you do
not release the pressure between each rep by taking a new
breath.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Blackouts under the bar can be a problem
because if you fall, your weight room surroundings are never a
comfortable place to land in a big heap with a loaded barbell. The press
and the rack position of the clean are the only two places that blacking
out is usually a problem, so be prepared if it happens. You will feel a
change in perception before the event occurs. If possible, rack or drop
the bar. If the feeling persists or gets worse (your knees will begin to
wobble), take a knee so you’ll have a shorter distance to fall. The
blackout itself is harmless and will pass in a few seconds with no
lasting effects; the fall is the problem, so be
careful.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The other way to be loose is to let the
elbows and the shoulders slide down, or to never get them up in the
correct position. When you fail to hold the elbows up, the shoulders
drop, too. This combination not only places the elbows in a bad
mechanical position to press, but also lets the bar drop down the chest
a little, thereby adding to the distance the bar must be pressed. A
longer bar path means more work done on the weight from a worse
position, thus decreasing the weight you can lift that way. Keep your
shoulders up and your elbows just in front of the bar so that the bar
path is shorter and more efficient and the bottom position is better
supported between reps. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Using an inefficient
bar path</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The second major problem is an
inefficient bar path. Barbells like to move in straight vertical lines,
and your job is to arrange your body movements so that the bar can do
this. You have to lean back before the press starts, and 95% of people
will not lean back enough to enable the bar to clear the chin without
introducing forward movement into the bar path. Leaning back enables you
to perform the press efficiently. Make up your mind that you are going
to lean back </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">before</span></span></span><span> you start every rep of
the press. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The heavier the weight, the greater the
tendency for the bar path to head away from the shoulder joints. When
the distance between the shoulder joints and the bar gets to the point
where the leverage created by this moment arm exceeds your strength –
even if the load itself does not – you will get stuck on the way up. It
is critical to keep the bar close. Three common bar path problems cause
this to happen; pushing the bar away, failing to get under the bar after
it passes the forehead, and leaning back away from the bar are all
different problems, but they all affect the press the same way.
</span></span></p>

<br />

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure
3-21.</span></span></span><span> Pressing efficiency is strongly
influenced by the mechanics of the pressing position: the shorter the
distance between the bar and the shoulders, the shorter the moment arm.
(A) Driving up close to the face provides this good mechanical position.
(B) Any movement of body or bar that increases the moment arm length is
detrimental to pressing efficiency. (</span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">M.A. = moment
arm</span></span></span><span>)</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>First, the most common form problem with
light weights is having the bar out in front too far, away from the
face; this problem is produced by a bar path that curves away from the
face (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_007.html#filepos350401"
class="calibre9">Figure 3-22</a>). Heavy weights like to move in
straight vertical lines because they represent less energy expenditure
than do longer, curved bar paths. This is true for all barbell
exercises, from the simple press to the more complex snatch and clean
and jerk. Heavy weights must follow a straight vertical bar path in the
press because heavy weights can’t be pressed in a curve. And if the bar
moves forward, your back must go backward so that the system’s center of
mass stays balanced over the mid-foot. This loss of control erodes the
position necessary for a powerful press, with the delts and triceps
driving up on the elbows held close to the body, in a position of
increased mechanical efficiency with a shorter lever arm. Sometimes
allowing the elbows to drop into a lower position is what makes the
forearms less than vertical. This is an easy thing to correct if you
catch it early: raise your elbows until they are just in front of the
bar, and aim the bar at your nose. After you lock the bar out at the
top, aim for your nose on the way down so you can practice keeping the
bar close </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">10</span></span></span><span> times per set of 5 reps.
</span></span></p>

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure
3-22.</span></span></span><span> Problem 1: Pushing the bar away from
the face produces pressing inefficiency and a curved bar path. This
error often happens if the bar is pushed forward to clear the chin due
to insufficient lean-back.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Second, leaving the bar out in front –
not “getting under the bar” – is a different problem, and it most
definitely will occur with heavy weights. When the bar has been started
perfectly straight up but the lifter fails to move forward under the bar
after it clears the head, the same position problem occurs at a higher
point in the bar path. You have to get in the habit of slamming your
body forward under the press just as soon as the bar passes your
forehead. This pattern must be embedded early in the process of learning
the exercise, and it must be consciously revisited each workout, from
the empty bar on up. </span></span></p>
<br />
<span class="calibre1"></span>
<p><span class="calibre7"><img src="./images/00172.jpg" class="calibre8"

<br />

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure
3-23.</span></span></span><span> Problem 2: The failure to get under the
bar after it crosses the top of the head leaves the long moment arm
between the bar and shoulders intact and unmanageable. With this error,
the lifter fails to take advantage of the torso driving forward to help
lock out the elbows.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>There is another way to make the body
get forward under the bar at lockout. As is so often the case in
athletics, a thing can be conceived of and understood in many different
ways. The lockout of the press can be thought of as the shoulders moving
forward under the bar, but it can also be approached from the opposite
direction, </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">as
the hips moving back</span></span></span><span> as the bar crosses the
forehead. These are obviously two different ways to explain the same
concept. If the lift starts with a slight hip extension, lockout is
facilitated when the hips are straightened fast and the shoulders and
elbows are driven up, as previously illustrated. Both the chest and
shoulders moving forward or the hips moving back produce the same net
effect relative to the bar; use the cue that helps you best. As you
become experienced as a lifter, you should get better at understanding
the mechanics of what is happening under the bar and be able to
visualize more solutions for movement problems you may be experiencing.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>An emphasis on getting forward under the
bar can result in a balance problem, noticeable as a tendency to be on
the ball of the foot during the drive and lockout. A good connection
with the ground requires that the weight be evenly distributed over the
whole foot even as the bar is centered over the middle of it. Any
shifting forward during the press must be done in the context of the
entire body staying in balance under the bar. If the forward shift is
sufficient to actually alter the center of gravity of the lifter/barbell
system, you will have to compensate by moving a foot or both feet
forward to avoid losing balance. Getting under the bar comes from a
shift in torso position, not from a shift affecting the body all the way
to the ground. Excessive movement disrupts the kinetic chain and the
lift. For some people, the initial forward hips position can be cued by
thinking about shifting the weight to the toes and squeezing the glutes,
but as soon as the drive upward starts the system must return to balance
over the mid-foot. Thinking about the mid-foot and its relationship to
the bar as a vertical slot in which to drive the bar upward is the best
cue for correcting a balance problem.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The third bar path problem is the
tendency to push yourself away from the bar. Leaning back during the
drive off the shoulders is a problem that gets worse as the weight gets
heavier. Hips are a vital part of the press, with a little hip extension
established to “cock” the drive off the shoulders. Timing gets off, and
you drive the bar up and then lean back from the hips, instead of
leaning back first and then driving the bar up. The distance between the
bar and the shoulders increases, not much at first but enough to kill
the press when the weight gets heavy. The bar path itself may start out
vertical, but as the leverage decays, the bar will drift
forward.</span></span></p>
<br />
<span class="calibre1"></span>
<p><span class="calibre7"><img src="./images/00173.jpg" class="calibre8"

<br />

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure
3-24.</span></span></span><span> Problem 3: Excessive layback is not the
same as pushing the bar forward. Note the position of the bar over the
mid-foot, except that the torso is too far behind the bar, contributing
to moment arm length and an excessive horizontal distance to make up
during lockout.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>This problem usually occurs due to a
loss of control over the lower back position, when the lean deteriorates
into a lumbar overextension instead of being a hip movement. Since
extreme loaded hyperextension of the lumbar spine is dangerous, it’s
best to never lose control of the back at all. The problem here will be
abdominal muscle control, and may simply be weak abs. The rectus
abdominis acts directly against lumbar hyperextension by providing
tension between the rib cage and the pubis, counteracting lumbar
hyperextension and increasing intra-abdominal pressure to reinforce
correct lumbar curvature from the anterior side of the trunk (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_007.html#filepos357404"

develop a strong set of abs. </span></span></p>

for excessive layback. Very strong pressers have very thick sections of
rectus abdominis.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Heavy weights tend to blur awareness of
the fine points of technique and position, as anyone who has trained
heavy knows. We depend on our training, which has embedded the correct
motor pathways, and coaching – when we can get it – to keep our form
correct and efficient. Most often, when you miss a heavy press in front,
you won’t know why: a position error of a couple of inches is hard to
feel under a heavy weight. Most often you didn’t get under the bar. You
must drill this movement pattern during the warm-up sets, both in the
drive up and when lowering the bar, so that you can do it without a lot
of thought and conscious direction during the work sets.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>There are two breathing patterns that
can be used during the set. The first pattern, which seems to be more
useful for novices using lighter weights, is to breathe at the top of
the press, at lockout. It has to be a quick breath, taken without
relaxing anything that is supposed to be tight. It has the advantage of
allowing you to rebound the bar quickly off of your shoulders after the
first rep, making the press analogous to the bench press with the
stretch reflex at the bottom. This use of a stretch reflex is fine at
first, but most lifters tend to outgrow this and adopt the pattern of
breathing at the shoulders between reps. This second method requires
that the lifter stay very tight, with chest up during the breath, a
thing learned with experience. Breathing at the top allows a novice to
handle heavier weights while learning the skills necessary to maintain
control during the press, and it will work better for flexible people
who can get in a good forward lockout position to catch a breath.
Breathing at the shoulders allows the more experienced lifter the luxury
of a second or two of rest between heavy reps and maintains the
breathing pattern of the first rep throughout the set. Try both methods
and see which works better for you.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>As mentioned earlier, eye position is
important for good body position. It is also the key to good neck
positioning, and your cervical spine will appreciate the attention. If
you are having problems of any kind, especially an unpredictable bar
path or lockout position, always check to make sure your eyes are
looking at the right place. Or get someone else to check you during a
set; it is often hard to remind yourself to do this after the bar is out
of the rack. Correct eyeballs solve lots of problems with all the lifts
in this program.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Cheating with a push
press</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Another common problem is that when the
weight gets heavy, most people try to turn the press into a push press,
by starting the bar up with a push from the knees. This is a logical way
to cheat – after all, the hips and legs are much stronger than the
shoulders and arms, and a little sharp squat-like bounce generates a lot
of power. If a push press is the intended exercise, then at least do it
correctly, with the bar resting firmly on the deltoids for a firm
transfer of power to the bar, and a sharp dip and drive using a knee and
hip bounce, not a slow push out of the knees. The push press can be done
with more weight than the press can, much more with practice. But if you
are trying to do a press, you must do it with correct press technique,
which uses the quads to squeeze the knees into lockout and uses the hip
thrust to start the bar up. If the weight is too heavy to do with
correct press technique, take some off. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Some people are reluctant to admit they
have too much weight on the bar, in the same way that they are likely to
take too big an increase in weight each workout. The ego interferes with
thinking, causing an attempt to handle weights that cannot be lifted
with correct form. As with all exercises, correct form is necessary for
real progress and for safety. The push press enables heavier weight to
be handled, true, but the shoulders are doing less of the work while the
triceps are getting better at locking out the bar. This is fine if kept
in proper perspective: push presses make a good assistance movement for
the press, but they are no substitute for it. Strict work with good form
causes strength to be developed in the target muscle groups. More
important, you need to learn how to bear down on a hard rep and finish
it without cheating so that you develop the mental discipline to stay
with a hard task and finish it correctly. This is one of those indirect
benefits that can be obtained from physical education. If you learn
nothing else from training, it is very important to learn that your
limits are seldom where you think they are.</span></span></p>

Deadlift </span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<hr />
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Lower-back strength is an important
component of sports conditioning. The ability to maintain a rigid lumbar
spine under a load is critical for both power transfer and safety. The
deadlift builds back strength better than any other exercise, bar none.
And back strength built with the deadlift is useful: while the bar is
the most ergonomically friendly tool for lifting heavy weights, a
405-pound barbell deadlift makes an awkward 85-pound box more
manageable. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The basic function of the lumbar muscles
is to hold the low back in position so that power can be transferred
through the trunk. They are aided in this task by all the muscles of the
trunk: the abs, the obliques, the intercostals, and all of the many
posterior muscles of the upper and lower back. These muscles function in
isometric contraction – their main task is to prevent skeletal movement
in the structures they are supporting. When the trunk is held rigid, it
can function as a solid segment along which the force generated by the
hips and legs can be transferred to the load, which will lie on the
shoulders, as in the squat or the press, or go across the shoulder
blades and down the arms to the hands, as in the deadlift. There is no
easy way to do a deadlift − one which doesn’t involve actually picking
up the bar − which explains their lack of popularity in most gyms around
the world.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The deadlift is a simple movement. The
bar is pulled, with straight arms, off the floor and up the legs until
the knees, hips, and shoulders are locked out. Immense weights have been
moved in this way by very strong men. In powerlifting, the deadlift is
the last lift in the meet, and the expression “The meet don’t start till
the bar gets on the floor!” is very telling. Many big subtotals have
been overcome by strong deadlifts, especially in the days before squat
suits and bench shirts. The meet was often won by a lifter with a bigger
deadlift than his squat. It is hard to overstate the strength of a man
with an 800+ lb deadlift, a feat accomplished by only elite lifters.
Nine-hundred-pound contest deadlifts are more common than they used to
be, although many more lifters have done them with straps (which
eliminate the grip-strength aspect of the lift). </span></span></p>

<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The deadlift is brutally hard and can
therefore complicate training if improperly used. It is very easy to do
wrong, and a wrong deadlift is a potentially dangerous thing. There will
be a few trainees who simply cannot perform this movement safely with
heavy weights, due to a previous injury or an inability to perform the
movement correctly. The deadlift is also easy to overtrain; a heavy
workout takes a long time to recover from, and you must keep this fact
in mind when setting up your training schedule. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>For the vast majority of lifters, the
deadlift should be an essential part of training. It is the primary back
strength exercise, and it is an important assistance exercise for the
squat and especially for the clean (for which it is an important
introductory lesson in position and pulling mechanics). The deadlift
also serves as a way to train the mind to do things that are
hard.</span></span></p>

class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure 4-2.
</span></span></span><span> Stabilization of the spine during the
deadlift is essential and is accomplished the same way as in the squat.
Intra-abdominal and intrathoracic pressures increase in response to the
contraction of the trunk musculature coupled with the Valsalva maneuver.
</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>There are two ways to perform the
deadlift used in competition: the conventional, with the feet inside the
grip; and the “sumo” style, with the feet outside the grip. The
sumo-style wide stance produces the effect of shorter legs, thereby
allowing for a more vertical back angle and a shorter moment arm along
the trunk segment, thus reducing the effective load on the trunk segment
(<a href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_008.html#filepos371378"
class="calibre9">Figure 4-3</a>). This shortening is similar to the
effects of a snatch grip in Olympic weightlifting, which produces
artificially “shorter” arms for the purpose of reducing the distance the
bar travels to lockout overhead. Since our purpose is the development of
lower back strength through the effective use of exercises that work the
lower back muscles, the sumo deadlift will not be used in this
program.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>First, some general observations about
the deadlift, in no particular order. It can be used as a leg exercise
if injury prevents squatting. It is not nearly as effective as the squat
for this purpose, due to the lack of hip depth used in the starting
position (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_008.html#filepos371378"
class="calibre9">Figure 4-3, A</a>). But this is the very reason it can
be used if a knee or hip injury makes squats too difficult or painful,
and at least some leg work can be done while healing takes place. A
high-rep deadlift workout can provide enough work to maintain some leg
conditioning, even if the injury is something – such as a groin pull or
a not-too-severe quad tear – that would prevent the lifter from doing
heavier, low-rep deadlifts.</span></span></p>

The mechanical effects of stance and grip width on the lifter’s
relationship with the bar. </span> (A) Conventional deadlift start
configuration. (B) A wide (snatch) grip shortens the distance the bar
has to travel overhead, but because this grip essentially produces
artificially short arms, it also changes the back angle of the pull. (C)
Likewise, a wide stance in the deadlift (sumo, with the grip inside the
legs) produces artificially short legs. </span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Tremendous leg power can be exerted in
the deadlift starting position, which uses essentially a half-squat
depth, so the challenge is usually to keep your back tight to break the
bar off the floor. Quad strength is seldom the limiting factor in the
deadlift, although the hamstring strength often is. If the bar gets past
the knees with the back staying flat enough, the legs can lock out what
the back can support. If the bar stays on the floor, the problem is
either the grip, an injury producing sufficient pain to distract from
the pull, a lack of experience with pulling a heavy weight that would
rather stay where it is, or just too much weight on the bar.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>A deadlift requires the production of
force from a </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">dead</span></span></span><span> stop, thus the name.
Deadlifts differ from squats in more than just depth at the bottom: the
deadlift starts with a concentric contraction and ends with an eccentric
contraction. The squat begins eccentrically, as the bar is lowered from
lockout, and then returns to lockout with the concentric contraction, as
in the bench press. To review, an eccentric contraction occurs when the
muscle lengthens under tension, and a concentric contraction occurs when
the muscle shortens during tension. (Muscles don’t “flex”; they
contract. Joints flex and extend.) Sometimes referred to as the
“negative,” the eccentric phase usually lowers a weight, whereas the
concentric phase raises it. The stretch reflex occurs at the transition
between lowering and raising, and many studies have shown that a muscle
contracts harder concentrically when this contraction is preceded by a
stretch, which is the very thing provided by an eccentric contraction.
Demonstrate this to yourself by trying to do a vertical jump without
dipping down to start the jump. Or try applying this principle to
barbell curls by starting them from the top instead of from the bottom.
The down phase, if used skillfully, makes the up phase much easier. But
a deadlift is not preceded by any loaded stretch reflex, no matter how
much drama and hip movement the lifter engages in before the pull. Much
of the effect provided by the eccentric/concentric transition comes from
the viscoelastic energy stored in the muscles and tendons that are
elongating under a loaded trip to the bottom of the range of motion; if
there is no loaded trip, there is no energy to store. The deadlift
starts at the mechanically hardest part of the movement and requires the
lifter to generate the entire explosion necessary to break the bar off
of the floor and get it moving up, without any help from a negative or
anything else.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Grip strength is crucial to the
deadlift, and the deadlift works grip strength better than any other
major exercise. It is the limiting factor for many lifters with smaller
hands or short fingers, or for lifters who rely too much on their straps
when training. The lift is famous for its alternate grip to the extent
that many people use it just because they are deadlifting and they think
that’s just what you do when you deadlift. Using the double-overhand
grip as much as possible makes for stronger hands, though, and keeps the
stress on the shoulders symmetrical. The alternate grip prevents the bar
from rolling in the hands, since it is always rolling up into one hand
as much as it’s rolling down out of the other. In contrast, the straight
double-overhand grip makes you squeeze the bar. So if all the warm-ups
possible are done with a double-overhand grip, and the alternate grip is
reserved for the really heavy sets, grip strength develops quickly.
Novices are often able to pull their heaviest sets with a
double-overhand grip because their hands can be stronger than their
backs. More advanced lifters find that they need to flip a hand over to
an alternate grip when the weight gets very heavy. (Most lifters prefer
the non-dexterous hand for the supine, or underhand, side of the
alternate grip.)</span></span></p>

supinate the non-dexterous hand. </span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>For those not intending to deadlift at a
meet, straps may be a logical choice for the heavy sets, since using one
supine hand and one prone hand produces asymmetrical stress on the
shoulders, can cause or aggravate biceps tendon problems on the supine
side in some people, and has a tendency to push the bar forward of the
mid-foot on the supine side due to bicep tension. Your decision to strap
the heavy sets will be based on personal preference, flexibility, and
training goals. If you do your warm-ups without straps and go as heavy
as you can that way, your grip will still get most of the benefit of the
exercise, but without the supine-side shoulder problems that sometimes
accompany the alternate grip. </span></span></p>

</span></span></span><span> When properly used as training aids, straps
can remove grip strength as a limitation. Used inappropriately, they can
prevent the development of improved grip
strength.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Anybody who has trained the deadlift for
a few months has had the experience of pulling on a weight that seemed
too heavy even to break off the ground when tried with a double-overhand
grip, only to find that it goes up surprisingly easily when the grip is
alternated. The back will not pull off the floor what the hands cannot
hold, due to proprioceptive feedback that tells the back that the weight
is too heavy. When the grip is flipped and the hands don’t slip as the
load increases off the floor, the back doesn’t receive the signal that
makes it stop the pull. A long, heavy deadlift can get dropped from
higher up the legs with any style of grip, but most lifters cannot even
break a weight off the floor that is so heavy that it opens the hands at
the start of the pull. Deadlift straps have a place in training, but
judgment must be exercised here; they can cause as many problems as they
solve. Straps can allow heavier back training if grip is the limiting
factor, or they can cause grip to </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">be</span></span></span><span> a
limiting factor by preventing it from getting strong if they are used
too often with too light a weight.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The hands are prone to callus formation
as a normal part of training. All lifters have calluses, and need them
to protect the hands from blisters and tears. Skin adapts to stress like
all other tissues do; skin thickens precisely where it receives the
stress of abrasion and folding. Calluses are bad only if they are
excessive, and gripping the bar incorrectly causes excessive callus
formation. Most lifters do this and have never considered the role of
the grip in callus formation. Heavy calluses tear frequently, usually on
the distal palmar crease (and most often into the base of the ring
finger because ring wearing has already produced a starter callus
there). A torn callus makes the rest of the meet a challenge, eased only
by some lidocaine gel that you might have in the gym bag if this has
happened to you before. But if the bar is gripped correctly, callus
buildup is kept minimal and the problem is not nearly as
bad.</span></span></p>

class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure 4-6.
</span></span></span><span> </span> <span class="italic">(Left
panels)</span>, (A) Gripping the bar correctly, well down into the hook
of the fingers, will reduce the amount of callus development. <span
class="italic">(Right panels)</span>, (B) Gripping the bar too high in
the hand will allow the bar to slide down into the fingers, folding the
palm skin as it goes. This folding along the area between the distal
transverse crease and the proximal digital crease causes most callus
formation. If they become excessively thick, calluses can tear off
during heavy lifts and ruin the rest of your day.</span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>When you’re setting the grip, if you
place the bar in the middle of your palm and wrap your fingers from
there, a fold forms at the distal end of your palm, right before the
area where your fingers start. When you pull the bar up, gravity shoves
this fold farther down toward your fingers, increasing the folding and
stress on this part of the skin. A callus forms here as a result, and
the presence of the callus amplifies the folding problem by making the
fold even thicker. If you grip the bar farther down toward your fingers
to begin with, it can’t slide down much because </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">it’s already
there</span></span></span><span>. This is actually where the bar needs
to be, since gravity will pull it there eventually. And since the bar
should stop there anyway, you might as well start in this position. You
also get the advantage of having less far to pull the bar; if it is
farther down in your fingers, then your chest is up higher, your
position off the floor is easier, the bar locks out farther down your
thigh, and the bar has a shorter distance it has to move before being
locked out.</span></span></p>

<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Equipment can contribute to callus
formation, and this fact applies to all the lifts. A bar with an
excessively sharp knurl is an annoying thing to have to use in the
weight room. Older bars usually have better knurls than newer bars;
either the older ones are worn smooth or they were made more correctly
(it seems that companies decided to start making </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">Texas Chainsaw
Massacre</span></span></span><span> knurls in about 1990). Bad knurls
can be improved with a big mill file and about an hour’s
work.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Chalk is important for hand safety. It
keeps the skin dry and tight, making folding under a load less of a
problem. You should apply chalk before you start training every day, for
all the lifts. If your gym is one of those that do not allow chalk, for
reasons of cleanliness or perception, you need to reevaluate your choice
of gyms.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Gloves have no place in a serious
training program. A glove is merely a piece of loose stuff between the
hand and the bar, reducing grip security and increasing the effective
diameter of the bar. Gloves make bars harder to hold on to. The gloves
that incorporate wrist wraps prevent the wrists from getting used to
training. The only legitimate use for a glove is to cover an injury,
like a torn callus or a cut, when the workout is important enough to do
with the injury and it cannot be done without the covering. A desire to
prevent callus formation does not constitute a legitimate use. If your
gym makes a lot of money selling gloves, you have another reason to look
for a different gym. And if you insist on using them, make sure they
match your purse.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Deadlifts are hard. Many people don’t
like to do them. Most people, even the ones who will squat heavy and
often and correctly, will leave deadlifts out of the workout at the
slightest provocation. This is the reason most powerlifters squat more
than they deadlift – there was often no “time” to do them in the
program. But doing them adds back strength, and back strength is
necessary for the other lifts, and for other sports, work, and life. So
let’s learn how to do them.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Learning to
Deadlift</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The bar should be loaded to a light
weight relative to your capability. A light weight for a novice
55-year-old woman will be different from that for an 18-year-old
205-pound athlete. Your gym should be equipped to load weights as light
as 55 pounds, or possibly even lighter, to accommodate people of all
levels of ability. This makes it necessary to obtain 5–10 lb plastic
training plates that space a “45” lb (20 kg), 15 kg, or even 10 kg bar
off the floor to the same height as a standard plate: 17¾ inches, or 45
cm. If you cannot get these light plates, you can place blocks under 10
or 25 lb iron plates, or set the bar at the correct height in the power
rack; the small iron plates place the bar closer to the floor than most
people’s flexibility can accommodate in a correct starting position.
Judgment must be exercised here; the starting weight must be light
enough so that if your form is bad, you cannot hurt yourself, just in
case these instructions are not followed closely enough. So 55 pounds or
lighter will be the starting weight for some people, 40 kilos (88
pounds) will work for most women and lighter-bodyweight novices, and 135
pounds will work for athletes and more experienced trainees. There is
never a reason for anyone other than a competitive lifter to start
heavier than 135 pounds.</span></span></p>
<br />

<br />

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure 4-8.</span></span></span><span>
The standard plate diameter provides a standard height for the bar above
the floor. Different weights in this standard diameter allow people of
different strength levels to pull from this standard height, 8? inches
or 20.5 cm between the bottom of the bar and the
floor.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>This method for learning the deadlift
proceeds in five steps. Pay careful attention to each step as you are
learning. As the steps become more practiced and familiar, they will
merge into a continuous pattern of movements.</span></span></p>

Stance</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The stance for the deadlift is about the
same as the stance for a flat-footed vertical jump, about 8–12 inches
between the heels, depending on anthropometry, with the toes pointed
out. Bigger, taller people with wider hips will use a proportionately
wider stance. This stance is much narrower than the squat’s stance
because of the difference between the two movements: the squat is done
from the top down, with the hips lowered and driven up; the deadlift
starts at the bottom, with the feet pushing the floor, the back locked
in place, and the legs driving the floor away from the bar. The
difference in stance is due to this difference in hip and knee mechanics
and the need to accommodate a narrow grip for pulling efficiency (<a

The starting stance for the deadlift places the heels approximately 8–12
inches apart, with the toes pointed slightly out.
</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The bar should be 1–1½ inches from your
shins. For almost every human being on the planet, this distance places
the bar directly over the middle of the foot, the position over which
the bar stays on its way up to lockout. Most people are reluctant to
keep the bar close enough to their legs during the pull, as well as when
setting it down, and for that matter before the bar leaves the ground.
This reluctance is often due to the fear of marring the beauty of the
shins and thighs and a lack of appreciation of the significance of
balance in the pull. Efficient bar paths are straight vertical lines,
and if the bar starts from a position directly over the mid-foot and
travels vertically to lockout directly over the mid-foot, the most
efficient pull will have occurred. It is common to mistake the middle of
the </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">forefoot</span></span></span><span> – between the tibia
and the end of the toes – for the middle of the </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">whole</span></span></span><span>
foot, the place the bar should actually be. The bar should be positioned
with half the foot forward of the bar and half the foot behind it, so
that the bar is directly over the middle of the arch of the foot, the
point directly under which the weight of the lifter/barbell system is
centered across the sole of the foot against the
ground.</span></span></p>

<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>When you have the bar in this position,
point your toes out. The angle will be at least 10 degrees and maybe as
much as 30 degrees (see the picture of George Hechter in <a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_008.html#filepos497198"
class="calibre9">Figure 4-39</a>). Your toes might be more pointed out
than you want them to be. This stance places the hips in external
rotation just as it did for the squat, providing the same benefits: more
adductor and external rotator involvement in the movement, as well as
clearance between the femurs for the torso so that a good start position
can be obtained.</span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Step 2: Grip
</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>After you have assumed the correct
stance, grip the bar, double-overhand and thumbs around, at a width that
places your hands in a position in which your hands are close to your
legs, without being so close that you rub your thumbs against them as
you pull. This grip results in the shortest distance to lockout for the
barbell (as should be obvious from our discussion of the snatch grip
earlier). Bar markings are the knurling on a standard Olympic bar, which
will always have a smooth space in the middle (and which may have a
6-inch center knurl in the middle of this space). Standard bar markings
are at about 16½ inches for this middle space, so the grip can be set
according to this dimension. Most people’s hands will be about an inch
into the knurl, or about 18½ inches between hands. Bigger people will
need to use a proportionately wider grip to match their stance, while
most women will need to put their hands closer together than this, with
their index fingers on the edge of the knurl. Be aware that most people
tend to take too wide a grip. If your grip is 3 inches into the knurl
and your hands are touching your legs, your stance is too wide unless
you are very broad through the hips. </span></span></p>

<span class="calibre1"></span>
<p><span class="calibre7"><img src="./images/00201.jpg" class="calibre8"

<br />

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure
4-11.</span></span></span><span> The grip width should be just outside
the legs when the feet are in the correct position. This placement
allows the thumbs to just clear the legs on the way up.
</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Take your grip on the bar by bending
over at the waist, stiff-legged, without lowering the hips. Most
important at this point and for the following steps is that you
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="bold">DO NOT MOVE THE
BAR</span></span></span><span>. You have gone to considerable trouble to
place the bar directly above the mid-foot for pulling efficiency, and if
you move it during this or any subsequent steps, you will have undone
Step 1.</span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Step 3: Knees
forward</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>With your grip secure, bend your knees
and drop them forward just to the point where the shins touch the bar.
Again, </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="bold">DO NOT
MOVE THE BAR,</span></span></span><span> since it is already where you
want it over your foot. Hips do not drop down during this movement –
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">only the knees
and shins move</span></span></span><span>. Once the shins are touching
the bar, the hips freeze in position. They do not drop any farther. Now
shove your knees out just a little to establish the slight angle of the
thighs and knees that keeps them parallel to your feet. Knees will be in
contact with elbows after this happens, and that is fine. The correct
grip width will have the clearances very close during the pull, and if
the grip is correct and the thighs are externally rotated a little, the
knees will touch the elbows. Most people will try to lower their hips
during this step. If you do this, you will push your knees forward, thus
pushing the bar forward. Just touch the bar with the shins and shove
your knees out just a little. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Step 4: Chest
up</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>This will be the most difficult step for
most people: squeeze your chest up into the deadlift start position.
Lifting the chest is accomplished by using the muscles of the upper
back, and this starts a process of spinal extension that finishes at the
pelvis. While gripping the bar, being careful </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="bold">NOT TO MOVE
IT</span></span></span><span>, shove your rib cage up so that your chest
rotates up between your arms. Let this contraction continue down your
back until your lumbar spine is tightened into contraction as well. In
this way, your back is properly positioned for you to pull without
dropping your hips – the back will have positioned itself correctly so
you can pull from the top down instead of by lowering the hips, which
would shove the bar forward. DO NOT try to squeeze your shoulder blades
together in the back; scapular adduction will pull you down closer to
the bar into a position that you cannot maintain with a heavy weight
because that’s not where your shoulder blades actually stay during a
pull. When you are in the correct position, stare at a point 12–15 feet
in front of you on the floor so that your neck can assume its normal
anatomical position. You might need to think about keeping your chin
down, too.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>This step will be difficult because of
hamstring tension fighting against the proper extension of the lower
back. Remember: The back muscles and the hamstrings are in a war for
control over your pelvic position, </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">and the lower back must
win.</span></span></span><span> During this step, most people will try
to drop their hips. If you do this, the bar will roll forward of the
mid-foot. Your hips will probably be higher than you want them,
especially if you have been deadlifting using another method. Keep your
hips up, and compensate for this weird feeling by squeezing the chest up
even more. After you do a few deadlifts and your hamstrings get warm,
the movement will feel better and more familiar.</span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Step 5:
Pull</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Take a big breath and drag the bar up
your legs. This means exactly what it says: “drag” implies contact, and
the bar </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">never</span></span></span><span> leaves contact with your
legs on the way up to lockout. This step will be the first time that the
bar actually moves at all, and if you do it correctly, the bar path will
be a straight vertical line, starting at its position directly over the
mid-foot and ending at the top at arms’ length with your chest up, knees
and hips in extension, spine in the normal anatomical position, and feet
flat on the floor. If at any time during the pull the bar leaves your
legs – which often happens as the bar gets above the knees and near the
thighs – it will be off balance, forward of your
mid-foot.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>If the bar loses contact with your shins
as you start the pull, it has traveled forward. Leaving the bar out away
from the legs may be due to the perfectly natural desire not to scrape
the shins, but the bar must remain close to the legs to avoid getting it
out of balance. Make up your mind that you’re going to keep it close,
and wear sweats or thin shin guards to protect your shins if you have
to. If the bar moves forward anyway and you’re sure you are squeezing
your chest up, chances are that you were not in balance over the
mid-foot when you started the pull. This problem is commonly encountered
with people who are wearing weightlifting shoes with heels that are too
tall, or with people who have long legs and a short back. If this
happens, you will need to insert another step, </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="bold">Step
4.5:</span></span></span><span> </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="bold">before you start the pull, get your
weight back off of your toes</span></span></span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">.</span></span></span><span>
Don’t exaggerate this by trying to get back on your heels; just rock
back a little and get the weight off of your toes and back onto your
mid-foot, and then think about pushing the mid-foot straight down into
the floor.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>At the top of the pull, just lift your
chest. That’s all; don’t shrug your shoulders either up or back, and
don’t lean back. Just raise the chest. Seen from the side, this position
will be anatomically normal, with both lordotic and kyphotic curves in
unexaggerated positions, your eyes looking slightly down, your hips and
knees fully extended, and your shoulders back. This is the position your
body must assume to safely bear weight, and the correct back position
during the pull provides a safe way to transfer the load from the ground
to this upright position. Refer to <a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_008.html#filepos405746"
class="calibre9">Figure 4-12, 5d</a>, for this position.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Down should be the perfect opposite of
up, the only difference being that the bar can go down faster than it
went up. It is just as easy to injure the back by setting the bar down
incorrectly as it is by picking the bar up incorrectly, and it is
extremely common to set the bar down wrong, with a round back and the
knees forward, even if you have pulled it correctly off the floor. A
non-vertical bar path makes no more sense on the way down than it does
on the way up. Be sure that you lower the bar by first unlocking your
hips and knees, and then shoving your hips backward and letting the bar
slide down your thighs in a straight vertical line, with your lower back
locked in extension, in a movement that is the opposite of the upward
bar path. As the bar passes your knees, bend them to finish setting the
bar down, never unlocking the back. If your knees go forward before the
bar passes them on the way down, the bar will obviously have to go
forward to get around them, and this usually means that you will have
also released your tight back position. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Fix your eyes on the floor at a point
that is 12–15 feet in front of you, to put your neck in the normal
anatomical position, and pull a set of five. Think very hard and pay
close attention to your form, concentrating especially on your back
position and keeping the bar close to your legs. If you’re sure your
form is good enough, add weight for a few sets until it feels like the
next increase might be a problem, and that’s the first deadlift
workout.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Everything else can be wrong with the
deadlift and nothing really bad will happen, but if your low back is
round under a big load, safety will be compromised. So now is the time
to learn the most important part of the deadlift: setting the back
correctly. After you set the bar down, stand up without the bar and lift
your chest. At the same time, arch your lower back by thinking about
sticking your butt out. Refer to <a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_008.html#filepos408245"
class="calibre9">Figure 4-13</a> and imagine a coach touching you on the
chest to cue your chest-up position, and touching you at the small of
your back to cue your lumbar arch. The touch on your lower back gives
you a point to “curl” your low back around as you stick out your butt,
the net effect of which is to cause the erector spinae muscles to
contract under your conscious direction. </span></span></p>

<br />

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure 4-13.
</span></span></span><span> Become familiar with the position the back
should assume during the pull. Lifting the chest toward the hand of a
coach places the upper back in extension, and arching the lower back
around a hand in contact with the muscle bellies of the lumbar spinal
erectors puts the lower back in extension. </span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The arched position in which the
contracted spinal erector muscles place the lower back is referred to as
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">lumbar
extension</span></span></span><span>. You will probably not be able to
maintain this degree of lumbar extension at the starting position with
the bar on the floor because hamstring tension will pull your pelvis and
lumbar spine out of this position to some extent, depending on your
flexibility. A few people – usually women and underweight men – are so
flexible that they can produce lumbar </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">overextension</span></span></span><span> at the bottom
(<a href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_008.html#filepos411048"
class="calibre9">Figure 4-14</a>). This is not desirable at all because
an over-arched lower back is just as bad – and perhaps much worse – a
position for the lumbar discs and their normal weight-bearing ability as
a rounded one. A loaded, overextended lumbar spine can not only harm the
intervertebral discs but also damage the facet joints and the close-by
nerve roots. The desirable position is an anatomically normal lordotic
curve or normal anatomical arch. But to achieve this, most people will
need to concentrate on an exaggerated extension, because even the
correct arch will test the limits of most people’s flexibility. The
point here is to learn to set your back and identify and control the
muscles you must use to do this, so that you can quickly develop the
correct position. Once again, just to be sure you understand:
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="bold">an overextended
lumbar arch is NOT the position to use to start the deadlift. Normal
anatomical position is.</span></span></span><span> But it may be
necessary to </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">try</span></span></span><span> for overextension in order
to produce normal anatomical position.</span></span></p>

</span></span></span><span> </span> (A) The correct starting position
for the lower back uses a normal anatomical arch. (B) A hyperextended
lordotic curve is both unnecessary and counterproductive, as well as
being difficult for people of normal flexibility to attain. The idea
that the lumbar spine must appear to have a visible lordotic curve in
order to be in the correct position is a misconception based on the
appearance of skinny people in this position. Muscular men will be in
the correct position when the low back appears flat due to the muscle
mass of the erectors. Be aware that a hyperextended position is not
actually desirable, but an inflexible person might need to <span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">try</span></span></span><span> to
hyperextend just to get into a correct lordotic position.
</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The majority of the problems encountered
in the deadlift will involve an incorrect lower back position. Most
novice trainees who exhibit the most common incorrect back position in
the deadlift – a round lower back – are completely unaware of their back
position. They are unable to identify the correct position, the
incorrect position, or any position in between. This may be your problem
if you struggle for more than a couple of workouts with your deadlift
form. You may lack the </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">kinesthetic sense</span></span></span><span> – the
ability to identify the spatial position of your body or a body part –
required to perform the movement correctly. The cause of this may be
related to visual perception: you can’t see your lower back, and you
haven’t even attempted to look at it. You can tell if your elbows are
flexed or extended, but you have no idea if your low back is flexed or
extended, probably because you haven’t thought about it before, because
you can’t see the muscles involved. Arms are in view, both in a normal
field of vision and in a mirror, and it is natural to relate voluntary
control to an observed, observable movement. In contrast, the lower back
is behind you, and it would require a truly innovative mind to think of
an excuse to look at the action of the lower back in a mirror from
profile while picking up stuff in the garage. </span></span></p>

<br />

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure
4-15.</span></span></span><span> A rounded lower back is the most common
problem encountered for most people learning the deadlift. Step 4 in the
setup is where this must be corrected.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Fixing low back problems requires an
awareness of what the lumbar muscles do, what it feels like when they
are doing these things, and what must be done to do them every time.
Repeat the action of lifting your chest and sticking your butt out
several times to practice the voluntary contraction of these muscles.
Just to be sure, get on your belly on the platform and do the drill
described in the <a
href="#filepos175340"
class="calibre9">“Back” section</a> of the Squat chapter a few times,
too. Setting the back is essentially the opposite of a sit-up, which is
an active flexion of the spine. Active extension of the spine activates
the muscles on the other side of the torso, and thinking about it this
way can help.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Once you know what an extended low back
feels like, you can get yourself into a good position at the bar in
steps. Take your correct starting stance, set your back, and lower
yourself into position a little at a time by shoving your butt back,
your knees out a little, and your shoulders forward, going down until
you feel your lower back break out of extension. Then come back up as
high as necessary to set it in extension again, and then try to get a
little lower than the last time. In this incremental way, you can
eventually get into a reasonably good starting position at the
bar.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Back injuries are fairly common in the
weight room, and unfortunately this is a part of training with heavy
weights. Both squats and deadlifts, as well as cleans and all other
pulling exercises, can produce these painful, inconvenient, and
time-consuming problems. But knowing what actually causes them can lend
a whole new perspective on how necessary it is to prevent position
errors that result in these injuries. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>If you go to the doctor when you have a
back injury, nine times out of ten she will tell you that “You just tore
a back muscle. Take these drugs and quit lifting so much weight.” This
diagnosis and recommendation reflect a lack of personal experience with
these types of injuries and a lack of understanding regarding how and
when muscles actually get torn and how they heal. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Torn muscle bellies bleed. They are
vascular tissues, and a tear of any significance disrupts the
connective-tissue components of the muscle belly to the extent that the
contractile and vascular components burst; blood then begins to
accumulate in the area of the tear, producing a hematoma. This looks
like a large bruise and goes through the same processes that bruises do
as they reabsorb and heal. Bad tears will leave a visible gap in the
muscle belly. Minor tears hurt like hell, too, but they don’t bleed
enough to make a noticeable bruise. Little ones heal quickly, while a
major tear can take several weeks.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The majority of muscle tears occur in
the thighs and legs, with bench pressing accounting for quite a few torn
pecs. These muscles are attached to long bones that either move heavy
weights over a long range of motion or accelerate the bones themselves
very quickly over a long range of motion. In tears that occur during the
bench press or the squat, the weight itself provides more resistance
than the muscle can temporarily overcome and the rupture strength of the
contractile tissue is exceeded. These tears can occur at any velocity of
movement, even after sufficient warm-up. More commonly, running injuries
occur in which the contractile strength of either the agonist or the
antagonist muscle exceeds the rupture strength of the opposing
component. Hamstrings, quads, and calves are torn with unfortunate
frequency, and this becomes more common as athletes age and lose both
muscle and connective tissue elasticity. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The common feature of muscles that are
the most subject to belly rupture is the job they do: they accelerate
long bones around an angle. To do this, they produce long ranges of
motion and relatively high angular velocities. Contrast this to the job
of the spinal muscles: they produce and hold an isometric contraction.
They are postural muscles, and their primary function is to hold a
column of small bones in a constant position relative to each other.
Their morphology reflects this task: the spinal muscles are long
muscles, true, but they all have multiple origin and insertion points on
a closely spaced, segmented, bony structure that is designed to be held
in place while the appendicular structures – the arms and legs – propel
it through space. The vertebral column depends on stability for its
structural integrity, and though it features a relatively limited amount
of flexure, it must be held rigid as it bears a load. Lifting weights
requires this rigidity, and the postural muscles of the trunk provide
it. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Back injuries often occur during
lifting, and most usually occur when someone is lifting incorrectly. But
even when this does occur, the circumstances are markedly different from
those in which a hamstring tears. A leg muscle tears during a long
angular contraction that involves a significant change in the muscle
belly’s length over a long ROM, whereas a back injury occurs over a
small intervertebral ROM that may involve little or no movement within
the erector belly. Even if the entire lumbar musculature completely
relaxes, not much movement will have occurred, certainly not when
compared to a sprint stride. This makes it highly unlikely that you will
actually rupture a back muscle belly while picking up a sack of
groceries, yet these low-force, low-velocity types of activities are
precisely where most back injuries happen. In the absence of blunt
trauma, true back muscle ruptures are quite rare.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Most back injuries are, unfortunately,
spinal in nature. Think of them as joint injuries, like a knee injury.
The intervertebral discs and facet joints are quite susceptible to
loaded abnormal intervertebral movement, the kind of movement that back
muscle contraction is supposed to prevent. Strong back muscles developed
through correct lifting technique are perhaps the best preventative for
back injuries, since the habits you form while lifting correctly
contribute to spinal safety just as much as the strength it produces
does. Knowing this, pay extra attention to form while learning to pull
off the floor; it will come in handy. That’s a promise.

<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>First, let’s make a few general
observations about the behavior of the physical system we’re working
with here. </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">Moment</span></span></span><span>, or rotating force
(sometimes the term </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">torque</span></span></span><span> is used), is the force
applied along a rigid bar that makes an object at the end of the bar
turn around an axis. Moment is at its maximum when applied at 90 degrees
to the thing being rotated. Think about turning a nut with a wrench;
your hand placed at a weird angle to the wrench is not strong, and the
strongest position is one in which your hand is at a right angle to the
wrench. This is why a mechanic always wants to have enough room to get
his arm at right angles to his wrench on a stuck bolt.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Moment also increases with distance away
from the thing being turned. A grip on the wrench turns the bolt more
easily the farther it is from the bolt. The </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">moment
arm</span></span></span><span> is the distance between the bolt and your
hand on the wrench, measured at right angles between the bolt and the
direction you’re pulling on the wrench. A longer wrench works better
than a shorter one because the longer length creates a longer moment arm
if the angle of the pull remains efficient. The moment arm’s length is
determined by both the length of the segment and the angle of the pull.
A long wrench pulled from an angle that is less than 90 degrees will not
turn the bolt well because the horizontal distance between the pull and
the bolt is not as long as the wrench; i.e., you have created a short
moment arm. Likewise, a short wrench pulled at 90 degrees is not an
effective tool for a tight bolt because of the short moment
arm.</span></span></p>

The important mechanical concept of the moment arm, as illustrated by
the wrench and bolt. </span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>This fact applies to all situations
where a weight is lifted by the back, i.e., pulling or squatting.
Gravity operates in a straight vertical line in the direction we call
“down.” A bar in the hands always pulls straight down, so the moment arm
in this system is always measured from the bar horizontally. A short
back at a more horizontal angle might have the same moment arm length as
a longer back at a more vertical angle. The best setup would
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">seem to
be</span></span></span><span> a short back at a vertical angle, but we
are, unfortunately, limited by the other physical constraints on the
system in our ability to make our pulling mechanics more favorable. If
the back is short relative to the legs, making the back vertical will
drop the hips, which shoves the knees forward, which inclines the shins,
which pushes the bar forward. This sequence puts the bar forward of the
mid-foot and puts the shoulders behind the bar, neither of which will
work at heavy weights, for reasons we shall soon
investigate.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>A wrench-and-bolt model works just fine
for simply describing a moment arm, but it’s not really an accurate
depiction of what happens at the hip joints in a deadlift. There is
another way of describing the mechanics of the pull. The hip and the
spine held rigid by your trunk muscles form a Class 1 lever. To refresh
your memory, a Class 1 lever places the fulcrum between the load and the
force that moves it, with the rigid member being the object that
transmits the force, like a seesaw (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_008.html#filepos427694"
class="calibre9">Figure 4-17</a>). The moment arms are the segments of
the rigid member on either side of the fulcrum. If they are the same
length, the force applied to the load is the same as the weight of the
load if the system is in balance, and the distance each side moves is
the same. If one side is shorter and the other side longer, the short
side moves a shorter distance, more slowly, while the longer side moves
a longer distance more quickly. But the speed at the longer end comes at
the expense of higher force at the shorter end, with the force at the
short end being multiplied by the length of the bar at the long end. So,
a Class 1 lever can move a heavy weight a short distance more slowly if
you push (or pull) down on the long side, like a crowbar prying loose a
nail. Or it can move a light weight faster if you push (or pull) down
hard on the short side, like stepping on a rake and having the handle
hit you in the face, or the way a trebuchet worked in the olden days of
siege warfare.</span></span></p>

</span></span></span><br />
<br />
</p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Because our muscles can contract only a
small percentage of their length, our skeletal system is composed of
levers that multiply the distance of their contraction at the expense of
an increased force production requirement. The human hip is a Class 1
lever. The back and the pelvis form the rigid segment; the hip joint is
the fulcrum; the hamstrings, glutes, and adductors of the posterior
chain are the force pulling down behind the hips (the short segment);
and the load in your hands is the force pulling down in front of the
hips (the long segment) (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_008.html#filepos429879"
class="calibre9">Figure 4-18</a>). If the force generated by the
posterior chain is high enough – if you are strong enough – the short
segment behind the hips can lever up the long segment in front, even
with a heavy weight. The simultaneously extending knees complicate the
system, but not much. If we could design the system to deadlift heavy
weights, we’d put the hips closer to the bar. But since we can’t, we
have to design the pull to make the most of the mechanics we have, and
this is why we keep the bar as close to the hips as we can get it. Some
advanced lifters use an intentionally rounded upper back to shorten the
distance between their hips and the bar. As we’ll see, this is properly
the job of the lats.</span></span></p>

</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>This leverage system operates when you
deadlift. But if you’re strong enough, the moment arm works the other
way, too; the short side moving a short distance with enough force can
make the long side accelerate its load over a long distance. This is
what happens in a clean or snatch.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The bar path in a heavy deadlift should
theoretically be straight, because that is the shortest, most efficient
way to move an object through space from one point to another, and
vertically up, because that is opposite to the direction in which
gravity is pulling the barbell. </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">Work</span></span></span><span>
is defined as force (in the case of work against gravity, the force of
gravity acting on the mass of the loaded barbell) multiplied by distance
(the measured distance the barbell has to travel), and can therefore be
expressed in foot-pounds. Since gravity operates straight down, the only
work that can be done </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">against gravity</span></span></span><span> is straight
up, and any other movement represents energy expended doing something
else. Force can be applied to the bar horizontally – in a direction
either forward or backward relative to the lifter – and cause the bar to
move forward or backward on its way up, but this horizontal force cannot
cause work to be done against gravity. In other words, you can walk
around the room with the bar if you want to, but the deadlifting part
consists of the work done to change the vertical distance between the
bar on the floor and the bar in your hands at lockout. The shortest
distance a deadlift can travel is a straight vertical line, and a longer
bar path is therefore less efficient. Most sports-related movement –
think of judo, downhill skiing, or football – is not as simple as a
straight vertical line, but the movements involved in lifting barbells
can be, so they </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">should</span></span></span><span> be.</span></span></p>
<br />

<br />

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure
4-19.</span></span></span><span> The work done against gravity is purely
vertical displacement because the force of gravity acts vertically. Any
other movement of the bar is horizontal motion that does not represent
work done against gravity and is therefore effort spent inefficiently.
</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The deadlift places the bar in front of
the legs, creating a different situation than exists in the squat and,
to a lesser extent, the press: the bar is not balanced on the shoulders
and directly over the mid-foot, with a roughly equal amount of body mass
on either side of the bar that can remain in balance during the lift. A
deadlift must stay in balance with most of the body behind the bar. This
requirement creates a situation in which the center of mass (COM) of the
lifter/barbell system must be considered. During the deadlift, this COM
will vary slightly, and cleans and snatches are more complicated than
deadlifts due to their longer range of motion and increased
musculoskeletal complexity. Light deadlifts actually balance differently
than heavy deadlifts – the heavier the weight, the closer the loaded
barbell approximates the COM of the body/barbell system, and the less
important the body mass behind the bar becomes. A light deadlift can
therefore leave the ground from a position more forward of the exact
middle of the foot than a heavy deadlift can, and the same is true of a
snatch or a clean. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>It should also be obvious that the
closer the barbell is to the body’s own COM, the shorter the moment arm
will be between them, and the less leverage there will be between the
components of the lifter/barbell system. The closer you can get the bar
to the body’s COM without getting behind the mid-foot, the less leverage
between them you must overcome while lifting the load. Any distance
between the bar and the balance point at the mid-foot constitutes a
moment arm as well, one that has a profound effect on pulling
efficiency, as we will see. And as mentioned earlier, the greater the
distance between bar and hips, the longer the moment arm is against the
hips. So, as is the case with all other barbell exercises that involve
standing with the bar in the hands or on the back, leverage is optimal
and the bar is in balance when it is right over the middle of the foot.
And it should never deviate from this bar path where it is in balance:
right over the middle of the foot in a straight vertical line. This bar
path should be recognized as the ideal physical model we try to
approach; a good deadlifter gets very close. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The deadlift uses force generated by the
extension of the knees and hips to drive the bar off the floor to
lockout. The force is transmitted along the rigid spine, acting as a
moment arm rotating at the hip between the hip extensors and the weight
of the bar. This moment force is transmitted to the scapulas (more
correctly, </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">scapulae</span></span></span><span>) and to the arms, and
then down the arms to the bar. The scapula, a flat bone with a
comparatively large surface area, interfaces with the rigid back as it
lies against the rib cage, and is anchored in place by the extremely
strong trapezius as well as by the rhomboid major and minor, the levator
scapulae, and other muscles. The trapezius originates at the base of the
skull and – by the </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">nuchal ligament</span></span></span><span> – all along
the spinous processes of the cervical spine to C7, and from the spinous
processes of C7 to T12, making this muscle origin the longest one in the
human body. All of these fibers have an insertion point on some part of
the shoulder: either the long bony ridge that runs down the length of
the scapula (this ridge is called the </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">spine of the
scapula</span></span></span><span>) or the superior aspect of the
clavicle. The traps can therefore transfer force from a very long line
of attachment on the spine to a very long line of attachment on the
shoulders. (This is why the deadlift is such a good builder of traps and
why good deadlifters have bigger traps than other athletes.) Although
the traps can concentrically shrug the shoulders, adduct the scapulas,
and depress the scapulas, their function in the deadlift is isometric –
they hold the scapulas in place. When you are in position to pull the
bar off the floor, with a back angle of somewhere between 20 and 30
degrees, depending on your anthropometry, the scapulas lie flat against
the Valsalva-supported rib cage. They are held in place there by the
traps and rhomboids, and are thus in a well-supported position to
receive the force coming up the rigid trunk from the extending hips and
knees.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The humerus is attached quite thoroughly
to the scapula at the </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">glenoid,</span></span></span><span> or shoulder joint, by
several ligaments, the deltoids, the rotator cuff tendons and
musculature, the long head of the triceps, the biceps, and the teres
major muscles. The delts have a long origin all along the inferior side
of the spine of the scapula, directly across the bone from the trap
attachment, and they wrap around to the front along the acromion and the
outside one-third of the clavicle. The delts insert on the
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">deltoid
tuberosity</span></span></span><span> on the lateral side of the
humerus, a large bump almost halfway down the shaft. This assembly – of
spine to trapezius to scapula/clavicle to deltoid to humerus – produces
a very robust, effective piece of force-transfer architecture. The teres
major ties the bottom of the scapula to the front of the humerus, close
to the glenoid, adding to the musculature connecting the two bones.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The latissimus dorsi muscles have a very
important role to play here, too: they arise from a very broad origin on
the lower back, starting for most people (there are variations between
individuals) at the T7 spinous process and sweeping down with the
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">thoracolumbar
fascia</span></span></span><span>, a broad sheet of connective tissue
with fibers on the sacrum and the iliac crest of the pelvis. The
insertion of the lat is on the front of the humerus at the top, very
close to the pectoralis major insertion, so its function is to pull the
humerus back; this function is very important to the mechanics of the
pull. So the humerus has attachments both from the scapula and directly
from the spine, and every spinous process in the spinal column, from
skull to sacrum, is connected by either lats or traps to the humerus,
with both overlapping from T7 through T12. All of these attachments form
a rather thorough and effective connection between the back and the
arms. </span></span></p>

<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The correct position from which to pull
will be one in which the scapulas, the bar, and the mid-foot are aligned
vertically. The back will be held rigid in its normal anatomical
position, the elbows will be straight, and the feet will obviously be
flat against the floor. This is the position in which the skeleton most
effectively and most efficiently transfers force – produced by the
muscles that extend the hips and knees – up the back and down the arms
to the loaded barbell. Furthermore, this principle is true for any pull
off the floor, with any grip or stance. This alignment produces optimum
balance between the lifter/barbell system and the balance point in the
middle of the foot. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Any other bar position has the potential
to create two problems. The first problem, occurring when a barbell is
pulled from a position forward of the mid-foot, is a moment arm between
the barbell and the balance point. The lifter must compensate for this
moment arm in some way, either by moving the bar back into balance or by
applying the extra force needed to act against both the load on the bar
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">and</span></span></span><span> the effect of the moment
arm. The distance also has a detrimental effect on the hip, knee, and
back angles, causing them to assume less-than-optimal relationships with
each other and the bar. This is intuitively obvious if you stand with
the bar a couple of feet in front of you – the distance is a huge
problem, and when it is exaggerated in this way, the reason is clear.
Cut the distance in half by stepping forward, and pulling will be easier
but still not correct. Halve the distance again and the trend becomes
apparent: the closer you are to the bar, the easier it is to pull; and
the reason is the distance’s effect on the leverage against the
mid-foot. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span> Even a casual examination of the bar
paths of heavy deadlifts, cleans, and snatches demonstrates a tendency
for a barbell pulled from a position forward of the mid-foot to move
back into balance, producing a curved bar path off the floor. The
heavier the pull, as in deadlifts, the smaller the curve in height and
amplitude. The lighter the pull, as in snatches, the larger the
horizontal displacement that can be tolerated, and the higher the bar
can go before settling into balance over the mid-foot. (Some snatches
may be so light relative to the lifter’s absolute strength that they can
be pulled through their entire bar path out of balance.) You can see,
then, that balance exists directly over the mid-foot, and that it makes
sense to design your pulling technique to conform to this physical
reality by pulling the bar off the floor in a straight vertical
path.</span></span></p>

standard pulling model. Note the angle at which the arm hangs relative
to vertical. </span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The second problem, occurring with any
bar position that is not slightly behind the front of the shoulders, is
a lack of equilibrium between the bar and the lifter’s arms and spine;
to obtain this equilibrium, people tend to move into the correct
position during the pull. In this position, your shoulders will be
slightly in front of the bar, and your arms will </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">not</span></span></span><span> be
perpendicular to the floor. It is a common feature of all pulls from the
floor that after the back angle stops changing – i.e., the back has
settled into a stable angle as the knees and hips extend at the bottom
of the pull – the arms do not hang vertically. They hang at an angle of
somewhere between 7–10 degrees behind vertical, placing the shoulders
just in front of the bar and, perhaps coincidentally, directly under the
scapulas. Most Olympic weightlifting coaches teach this position,
shoulders in front of the bar, and a quick online search through the
many thousands of available videos of deadlifts, cleans, and snatches,
viewed frame by frame, will quickly demonstrate the universal nature of
the shoulders-forward position during the pull. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>A continuum can be observed from light
to heavy pulls: snatches, being very light relative to deadlifting
capacity, can be observed to poorly conform to this model for some
inefficient lifters. Cleans, being heavier than snatches but still
lighter than deadlifts, are more likely to conform, and heavy deadlifts
almost always conform as soon as the bar leaves the floor. Furthermore,
the tendency of the lifter/barbell system to seek equilibrium in the
shoulders-forward position is so inherent in pulling the barbell that if
someone tries to pull with vertical or behind-vertical arms, the back
angle will change – either before the pull starts or during the first
part of the pull – in order to produce this position. The tendency to do
this varies with weight in the same way the tendency of the bar to move
toward the mid-foot balance point does, with snatches showing a lot of
back-angle change over a longer portion of the pull, cleans showing much
less, and deadlifts almost always starting the plates right off the
floor with the same back angle used until the bar approaches the knees.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Keep in mind that a straight vertical
bar path is the most physically efficient expression of barbell movement
in a gravitational framework. Starting positions that place the bar
forward of mid-foot or that involve vertical arms will either cause the
bar to be pulled in a non-vertical path or cause a shift in back angle,
both of which are costly in terms of unnecessary energy expended on the
lifter’s body or the barbell. Not only is a bar that is farther away
from the hips harder to pull because of the longer moment arm between
bar and hips, but movements that do not contribute to the vertical
displacement of the load also represent wasted work capacity. Although
some very good lifters may excel at performing the lifts inefficiently,
this does not mean that their method is efficient. The most efficient
way to pull a barbell off the floor will be the way that produces the
most straight vertical bar path, because that’s the way that comports
with the fact that the actual work to be done against gravity in a
deadlift is the energy spent vertically displacing the weight as close
to the hips as possible.</span></span></p>

snatch, clean and deadlift.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Furthermore, the center-of-mass
considerations described earlier explain many aspects of this curved bar
path. Think of the two ways the bar can move: vertically and
horizontally. In a very general sense, vertical movement is accomplished
by muscular force generated along the rigid segments of the body
interacting with the load, and horizontal movement is accomplished by
manipulating the body’s mass in relation to the barbell. So pulling
force comes from the muscles that extend the knees and hips, and from
the muscles that keep the back rigid and keep the bar in the hands and
correctly positioned under the spine. Horizontal movement, made
necessary by the incorrect positioning of the body/barbell system over
the balance point, results from movement of the body’s mass in an
attempt to influence the position of the bar. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Some coaches teach that the hips should
be dropped, the shoulders should be positioned behind the bar, and the
back should be as vertical as possible. This start position will always
create a lot of movement in both lifter and barbell before the weight
actually leaves the floor, because this position places the bar forward
of the mid-foot as the hips drop and the knees drop forward, pushing the
shins and the bar forward, away from both the mid-foot and the hips. It
also places the lifter’s COM behind the bar. At heavy weights, the bar
out-masses the lifter by perhaps more than 300% in strong lifters. The
lifter can move the bar horizontally by manipulating the mass of his
body relative to the bar, as evidenced by the layback at the top of a
clean or snatch, where the bar is forward of the balance point. Since
the barbell is much heavier than the part of the lifter’s body behind
it, the reaction between the bar and body positions will be
proportionate to the differences in the mass. If the bar is forward of
the balance point by 3 inches as it passes the hips in a clean, the
layback will have to be </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">much greater than that</span></span></span><span> since
the body is lighter than the bar. And if the layback does not
sufficiently dampen the forward displacement, the lifter will have to
jump forward to make the catch. </span></span></p>

<br />

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure
4-24.</span></span></span><span> Use of the body’s mass is necessary to
produce a horizontal bar path component. The body’s pulling machinery
can efficiently move the bar upward, but the vertical orientation of the
lifter/barbell system cannot effectively move the bar horizontally. For
that, we make the mass of the body move horizontally to react against
the mass of the barbell. Since the heavy barbell out-masses the lifter,
his body must move further horizontally to effectively react against the
barbell.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The same thing happens when the bar is
on the floor: if you shove a heavy bar forward, your body mass behind it
reacts against the bar’s forward displacement by acting as a cantilever
for the horizontal motion necessary to bring the bar back into balance
over the mid-foot and closer to the hips. The feet are pinned to the
ground by the load, so as the pull starts, the mass of body behind the
bar reacts against the mass of the bar which is forward of the balance
point. The bar rolls back and leaves the ground in a curve as the body
swings forward around the hands and positions itself in equilibrium,
with the shoulders forward of the bar. As this position settles in, the
bar path becomes vertical. This movement is, of course, completely
unnecessary if the bar starts out in balance with the body’s preferred
position of pulling equilibrium so that a vertical bar path can be
produced. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The non-vertical arm angle is perhaps
the most poorly explained phenomenon in weightlifting. Why does the back
angle become stable for the first part of the pull when the shoulders
are in front of the bar and the arms assume their characteristic angle
of 7–10 degrees from vertical? Why is there an apparent equilibrium
between how far the shoulders are in front of the bar and how far the
hips are behind the bar? Our working theory is that the critical
relationship is the interaction between the lats, and the teres major,
the triceps, and the humerus. There is a back angle at which the lats
can best stabilize the arms and shorten the distance between bar and
hips in order to facilitate a vertical bar path, and a heavy deadlift
settles into this angle because it cannot do
otherwise.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The humerus is suspended from the
scapula by lots of muscle and ligament, and it would seem as though the
arms should just hang vertically, as a weight on the end of a rope
hanging from the ceiling hangs vertically, or “plumb” as it is called.
But the arms don’t hang vertically, not with a weight that is actually
heavy enough to force you to tighten your back and arms. Check the
videos yourself. If you want that rope to hang from the ceiling at any
angle other than vertical, you will have to apply another force to the
system from a different direction – you’ll have to tie
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">another
rope</span></span></span><span> to the one hanging plumb. And that
second rope will work best against the first one if you pull at a right
angle to the loaded rope, because a right angle is the configuration
that allows the force to be applied most efficiently. Like pulling on a
wrench at any angle other than 90 degrees, pulling on the rope from
anything other than a right angle fails to generate the maximum turning
force. It’s easier to see this when the first “rope” is your humerus,
and the second rope is your lat.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>So, there is another rope after all;
there are actually several of them. The teres major and the triceps
control the angle between the scapula and the humerus. The teres major
connects the inferior part of the scapula to the proximal end of the
humerus on the anterior side, only millimeters away from the lat
attachment under the armpit on the arm side. The triceps attaches the
superior scapula, up high on the shoulder side of the armpit, to the
elbow, although its leverage position is weak. More important, the lats
connect their large origin along the low back directly to the shaft of
the humerus, up under the armpit on the anterior side, so it pulls
across the full thickness of the shaft. These muscles add to the large
number of attachments from the shoulder joint area, which, working
together, transfer force from the trunk to the arms.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>This posterior pull is responsible for
the non-vertical angle of the arms as they hang from the shoulders under
a loaded spine, and must equal the tendency of the weight to rotate the
arms forward to a vertical position. If the arms rotate forward, this
will place the bar forward of the mid-foot and thus off-balance, unable
to be pulled if it is heavy enough. Since the triceps and the teres
major are actually minor contributors to the situation due to their poor
positions of leverage, the total contribution of the lats, teres major,
and triceps averages out to approximately the same as just the lats.
When the shoulder is in front of the bar and the back angle is stable in
a pull, the angle of attachment between the lat and the humerus is about
90 degrees, since </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">this is the angle at which the least muscular force is
required to produce a rotation force that is equal and opposite to the
weight</span></span></span><span>. It is the angle at which these
muscles can exert their tension on the humerus most efficiently and thus
provide the maximum force transfer and stability during a pull from the
floor in which the bar needs to stay over the mid-foot and as close to
the hips as this stable “hang” will allow (see <a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_008.html#filepos460905"
class="calibre9">Figure 4-25</a>). And the back angle adjusts to produce
the 90-degree lat angle in equilibrium between the shoulders and hips.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The fact that several muscles are
contributing to this posterior pull makes the angle hard to calculate
precisely, and some variation with anthropometry would be expected, but
the lats appear to be the major factor in the system, and the angle of
attachment in a stable configuration is probably very close to 90
degrees. What is absolutely clear is that through the bottom of the
pull, there exists a back angle in which the shoulders are in front of
the bar, the arms do not hang straight down, the hips are closer to the
bar than they would be if the arms did hang straight down, and pulling
the bar off the floor in this position results in a vertical bar path.
With this path, the lifter can most efficiently maintain the balance
point over the mid-foot and use the lats and related muscles to maintain
a vertical bar path. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Stated more succinctly,
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="bold">the arms are not
plumb in a deadlift because the lats do not attach to the arms at 90
degrees when the arms are plumb</span></span></span><span>. The arms
must slant back to achieve a position of stability as they hang from the
shoulders. So the body must assume a position that allows the arms to be
at 90 degrees to the lats and for the bar to be pulled in a straight
vertical line off the floor. If the hips are too low, the lat attachment
angle will be less than 90 degrees, and the hips will rise as the back
angle adjusts to the stable position. If the hips are too high, the
angle is greater than 90 degrees, and the lifter cannot as efficiently
prevent the bar from continuing forward.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The reference angles used in analyzing
the deadlift are the same as those used in analyzing the squat. The
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">hip
angle</span></span></span><span> is formed between the femur and the
plane of the torso. The </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span

class="italic">back angle</span></span></span><span> is formed between
the plane of the torso and the floor, which is assumed to be horizontal.
In a correct deadlift, the knees extend as the bar comes off the floor,
indicating that the quadriceps extend the knees under load. The back
angle should be constant until the bar approaches the knees; the
hamstrings “anchor” the pelvis so that this angle can be maintained
(more on this later). </span></span></p>

</span></span></span><span> The three reference angles: knee angle, hip
angle, and back angle.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The hip angle opens up only slightly as
the tibias get more vertical. As the bar approaches the bottom of the
knees, the back angle – and consequently the hip angle – begins to
change significantly (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_008.html#filepos465042"
class="calibre9">Figure 4-28</a>). Some people start this transition at
mid-shin, some higher, as there appears to be quite a bit of individual
variability in the precise position of the beginning of this shift.
Anthropometry is probably an important variable; arm length, for
example, obviously influences this balance relationship. In most
snatches and cleans, this back-angle shift appears to start a little
higher up the tibias – very close to the knees for most good lifters –
than it does in deadlifts, so it may be a function of the relative load.
The “shorter” arms and wider grip in the snatch may mitigate the lighter
weight used relative to the clean. The function of the lats changes
here, as the back angle becomes more vertical and keeping the
lifter/barbell system in balance over the mid-foot becomes a function of
the increasing back angle, and less dependent on lat tension. In all
pulls from the floor, this is seen in the bar path, which always tends
to come back over the mid-foot even if the bottom of the pull has been
inefficient. </span></span></p>

</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>As the hips extend more, the hip
extensors – the glutes, adductors, and hamstrings – become the
predominant movers of the load, the quads having finished most of their
initial job of extending the knees before the bar gets to them. The role
of the back muscles during the pull is to hold the trunk rigid and keep
the shoulder blades back in their normal anatomical position so that the
force generated by knee and hip extension can be transferred up the
back, across to the arms, and down to the bar. Lockout at the top occurs
when the knees and the hips reach full extension simultaneously, with
the chest up and the shoulders back. If this pulling sequence is
followed, the bar will come up the legs in a vertical
path.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>If the back rounds during the pull, some
of the force that would have gone to the bar gets eaten up by the
lengthening erectors. If the weight is sufficiently heavy, the rounded
back cannot be re-straightened and the deadlift cannot be locked out;
the spinal erectors are designed to hold an extended position
isometrically, not to actively extend a flexed spine under a compressive
load. The knees and hips are already extended – the knees in this
position are straight and the pelvis is in line with the femurs – and
their extensors cannot help since they are already fully contracted.
</span></span></p>

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure
4-29.</span></span></span><span> A rounded lower back is difficult to
straighten when the weight is heavy. The muscles that hold the lumbar
spine in extension are postural and are not designed to change the
relative positions of the vertebrae; their job is to maintain extension,
not to concentrically extend under compressive loading. And if the spine
is in flexion, the hips are, too. If the hip extensors have finished
their job, the pull is essentially finished. The only way to continue
the pull would be to “hitch” the bar with a knee re-bend that would
allow the hip position to reset a little. Many heavy deadlifts have been
missed this way. </span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The question of exactly what these three
angles should be is answered for each person individually since it
depends on individual anthropometry. People with long femurs, long
tibias, and relatively short torsos will have a more horizontal back
angle and a more closed hip angle than people with long torsos and short
legs, who will have a more vertical back angle and a more open hip
angle. Each person will have a different set of knee, hip, and back
angles, but the correct starting position for everyone will have the
previously discussed things in common: the shoulders will be slightly in
front of the bar; and the bar will be touching the shins directly over
the mid-foot, resulting in the vertical alignment of the scapula, bar,
and mid-foot. If this alignment is correct, and if the arms are
straight, the feet are flat on the floor, and the back is in good
thoracic and lumbar extension, the resulting reference angles are
correct for that person’s anthropometry. Of the three angles, the back
angle will exhibit the most obvious individual variability, easily seen
by an informed observer. </span></span></p>

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Arm length must also be considered when
you are analyzing these angles. All other segment lengths being equal,
short arms produce a more horizontal back angle and long arms produce a
more vertical back angle. Long arms tend to mitigate the effects of a
short torso, while short arms and a short torso make for a nearly
perfectly horizontal back. To balance the effects of short arms and a
short torso, people with this build might need to use a sumo stance,
since a wide stance produces the more vertical back angle typically seen
in people with more typical proportions. </span></span></p>

<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Most of the problems you will have with
deadlift form can be analyzed with a good understanding of pulling
mechanics. Consider, for example, the problem of lowering the bar with a
round back, caused by unlocking the knees first: the down phase is the
exact reverse of the pull. If the last thing that happens at the top of
the deadlift is the simultaneous extension of knees and hips, with a
locked back and the chest up, then the first part of lowering the bar
has to be knee and hip “un-extension” with a locked back and the chest
up (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_008.html#filepos473097"
class="calibre9">Figure 4-32</a>). The knees unlock just enough to take
the tension off the hamstrings, at exactly the same time that the hips
unlock. Then the butt travels back with the lower back locked, as the
lifter closes the hip angle and uses the hamstrings and glutes
eccentrically as they lengthen. As the bar slides down the thighs,
further closing the hip angle, it reaches a point as it passes the knees
where the knee angle can begin to close with the hips. As the bar is
lowered past the knees, they bend and the quadriceps add to the
hamstrings’ eccentric function, and the bar gets to the floor. This
sequence of movements – the opposite of the pulling-up sequence – allows
the bar to drop down in a vertical line (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_008.html#filepos371378"
class="calibre9">Figure 4-32</a>).</span></span></p>

opposite of up (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_008.html#filepos465042"
class="calibre9">Figure 4-28</a>). The last thing that happens on the
way up is the first thing that happens on the way down: the hips and
knees unlock simultaneously; then the hips move back and lower the bar
to below the knees; then the knees flex and lower the bar to the
floor.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Any deviation from this order will not
work. If your knees move forward first when you are lowering the bar,
they will be in front of the bar, and the bar cannot go straight down
because it has to go forward to get around the knees (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_008.html#filepos474802"
class="calibre9">Figure 4-33</a>). Your knees can move forward only so
far before your heels get pulled up, so you round your back to let the
bar go forward far enough to clear your knees. This action places the
bar off-balance, forward of the mid-foot. If you find yourself
progressing forward across the floor from the start to the finish of a
set of five, this is why.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure

down. The knees have moved forward first, and this places them in a
tragic position where kneecaps often pay a high price. And if the
kneecaps somehow remain unscathed, the lower back might not.
</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>As you pull the bar off of the floor,
your knees and hips extend together while your back angle stays
constant, meaning that the quads initiate the push off the floor while
the hamstrings hold the back angle constant, resulting in an opening of
the knee and hip angles. If you attempt to extend your hips first, the
result will be a non-vertical bar path. This happens when you lift your
chest first, thus opening the hip angle first and leaving the knee angle
in the start position. If this happens, the bar goes forward around your
knees, which have not pulled back out of the way. This actually occurs
only with very light weights; heavy weights like to move in straight
vertical lines. If you try to pull heavy weights chest-first, you will
be dragging the bar back into your shins, and the blood on the bar will
tell you this is wrong. And when it’s very heavy, the bar will not
travel forward around your knees anyway because you can’t pull a heavy
weight off-balance forward. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>When the knee angle opens first, as it
should, the shins get more vertical and move back relative to the front
of the feet, allowing the bar to travel in a vertical path up the legs.
If the knee angle changes first, the bar can move up in a straight line,
the way heavy bars like to move. If you feel the weight go to your toes,
or if your coach sees your heels come up, you know what you’re doing
wrong. Get your weight back off your toes, keep your chest up, and pull
the weight straight up your shins as you push the floor. This forces the
bar back into the correct path, which lets your knees straighten out and
lets your quadriceps extension start the deadlift correctly. It might
also be helpful to think about pushing the bar back into your legs with
your lats, reinforcing the close-to-the-shin position a second way (<a

<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>When the weight gets heavy, it is a
common error to let the bar come forward, away from your shins, before
it even leaves the floor. When this happens, your hips will have lifted,
also before the load moves. Using our pulling model, we can see that
when this occurs, the knee angle has opened, the hip angle has probably
stayed constant, and the back angle has become more horizontal, all
before the load has moved (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_008.html#filepos479972"
class="calibre9">Figure 4-35</a>). In this situation, your quadriceps
have extended your knees, but have not moved any weight while doing so.
In opening the knee angle unloaded – pushing your butt up in the air
without moving the bar – the quads have avoided participating in the
lift and have placed the entire job on your hip extensors, which now
have even more to do since they must move through a greater angle to
extend. In addition, since your back is now almost parallel to the
floor, your back muscles are in a position of decreased mechanical
advantage: they have to stay in isometric contraction longer while
rotating through a greater angle, starting in the worst mechanical
position they can occupy – parallel to the floor. </span></span></p>

leaves the bar away from the shins, and the work of lifting the weight
becomes predominantly hip extension. Technique errors that involve one
group of muscles failing to make their contribution to an exercise are a
common phenomenon in barbell training.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The reason for this is not immediately
apparent. In the deadlift, the clean, and all other pulling exercises
from the floor, raising the hips before the chest is a common enough
problem that we should analyze it here. The quadriceps straighten the
knees, and if the back angle stays constant while this happens, the bar
comes vertically up the shins. But it is the hip extensors – the glutes
and hamstrings and, to some extent, the adductors – that act as
stabilizers during the initial phase of the pull and maintain the back
angle by exerting tension on the pelvis from the posterior, at their
insertion points on the ischium and the ilium. If the spinal erectors
keep the back flat, the hip extensors anchor the back angle by pulling
down on the bottom of the pelvis. The pelvis and the spine are locked in
line by the erectors, so the hamstrings actually keep the chest up and
the back angle constant, allowing the quads’ function of straightening
the knees to push the bar away from the ground. During this phase, the
hip angle will open slightly, but the back angle should stay constant
relative to the floor. It is as the bar approaches the knees that the
hip extensors begin to actually change the back angle by actively
opening the hip angle. So, the function of the hamstrings and glutes
changes during the pull: initially they act to maintain the back angle
as the quads straighten the knees; then they change the back angle as
they extend the hips and finish the pull (<a

class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure
4-36.</span></span></span><span> The hip extensors – the glutes and
hamstrings and, to a lesser extent, the adductors – initially work only
to maintain the back angle as the bar rises from the floor. As the bar
approaches the knees, the hip extensors continue to contract, but at
this point they begin to actively open the hip angle.
</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>If the hamstrings fail to maintain the
back angle, then the butt comes up and the shoulders drift forward,
allowing the quads to avoid their share of the work since the knees have
extended but the bar has not moved. The bar, however, must still be
pulled, so the hip extensors end up doing it all, and in a much more
inefficient way. They should be working with the quadriceps through the
initial phase of the pull, instead of having to open a much more
horizontal back angle at the end of the pull. Either way, the hip
extensors work, but their job is easier if the initial contraction
controls the back angle and the last part is active concentric hip
extension, instead of the whole movement being a long, mechanically hard
hip extension. The problem is not that the hamstrings are not strong
enough; it is one of </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">motor learning</span></span></span><span>, teaching the
muscles to move the bones correctly, in the right order at the right
time. The only way to correctly address this problem is to take weight
off the bar and make sure you do the deadlift with proper form, with all
the angles correct, so that all the muscular contributors to the pull
learn to do their jobs in the right order. If you know the actual cause
of the problem – and you do now – you can fix it by thinking about
squeezing your hamstrings and glutes tight before you pull, thus making
them better at doing their job of holding your ass down. If this doesn’t
work, think about making your chest move up </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">first</span></span></span><span>,
which causes you to fire the muscles that would make this happen; the
hamstrings and glutes try to make the chest rise, and this action
averages out to a constant back angle.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>An interesting thing happens when all
the pulling mechanics are correct: the deadlift feels “shorter,” as if
the distance the bar has moved has been reduced, compared to an
uncorrected, sloppy deadlift. It obviously hasn’t, since the bar moves
the same distance either way, but the increased efficiency obtained from
the improvement in pulling mechanics is significant enough that the
perception is one of a shorter movement. This perception is largely due
to the reduction in extraneous hip and knee movement and a consequent
reduction in the time the lift actually takes. </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="bold">A correct pull that results from a
correct setup will show no change in back angle as the pull starts and
for at least the first couple of inches of bar path off the
floor.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>One of the most common technique errors
in the deadlift is using a starting position that attempts to hold the
back in a too-vertical position. The method detailed earlier for
learning the deadlift eliminates this problem, but hard-headed folks may
require further explanation. This misunderstanding of the correct
starting position may have several possible causes. One cause might be
confusion about the actual role of the back muscles in the deadlift.
Some resources on deadlift instruction available in the mainstream
certification agency material – intended for fitness/wellness audiences
that are not interested in strength – advocate a more vertical back
angle than is actually possible for a lifter to use in a deadlift of any
significant weight. According to these sources, in an attempt to reduce
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">shear</span></span></span><span>, or sliding forces,
between the vertebral segments, you should make the back as vertical as
possible so that most of the force on the vertebrae becomes compressive
rather than shear. However, shearing cannot occur because the vertebral
segments overlap at the facet joints, and sliding between the segments
is not anatomically possible. When the erectors and abdominal muscles do
their job of maintaining intervertebral rigidity, no movement takes
place, and when the load gets heavy enough that the erectors cannot hold
rigid extension, spinal flexion occurs, not shear. The back functions as
a rigid segment, and its job is to stay flat. Sometimes this is hard,
and this is why the deadlift is a back exercise. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Another cause of the confusion might be
the idea that the deadlift is somehow just a squat with the barbell in
the hands, and that driving with the legs is best accomplished with a
more squat-like starting position. But the deadlift is
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">not</span></span></span><span> a squat with the bar in
the hands – it is a pull, a completely different piece of mechanics. And
if it were a squat, you’d want your hips to be as high as you could get
them because you can half-squat more weight than you can squat from a
deep position since you don’t have to travel as far.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Confusion about the correct starting
position might also be due to the idea that the weight on the bar should
not be allowed to pull you forward, and </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">back</span></span></span><span>
is therefore the direction the bar should be pulled. But it should be
obvious that the bar cannot be pulled back through the legs. Or the
problem might be that an observation of the sumo-style deadlift as
performed by competitive powerlifters has created an incorrect
impression of the proper back angle in the conventional deadlift. Sumo
technique employs a much wider stance, which produces the correct
pulling position with a more vertical back angle. When a lifter tries to
assume this position and back angle with a close stance, he lowers his
hips to a point where he achieves the angle, but only at the expense of
placing his shoulders behind the bar. Since the bar cannot leave the
floor in this position, when the pull starts, the lifter’s hips will
rise and the back angle will adjust itself to the point where the
shoulders are in front the bar, and only then will the plates break off
the floor. </span></span></p>

<br />

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure
4-37.</span></span></span><span> The correct starting position (A), and
the position that often gets used instead (B). The correct position
reflects proper pulling mechanics; from this position, the bar can leave
the ground and travel in a straight path up to lockout. From the
incorrect position, the bar cannot leave the ground with a heavy weight,
yet many people think it is the correct position from which to pull.
What actually happens is that the lifter “sets up” in position B,
thinking that the bar leaves the ground from there, but he then raises
his hips into position A before the bar leaves the ground. Even a
cursory video analysis of any heavy deadlift clearly shows that this is
always the case. This shift from setup to pull leaves the bar out in
front of the shins as the knees pull back, producing a bar path that
curves back toward the legs before it becomes vertical. The most
efficient pull is a straight vertical line over the mid-foot, with the
shoulders just in front of the bar. The closer to this model your setup
position allows you to be, the better. </span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>It is an error in understanding the
mechanics of the start position to try to assume a back position more
vertical than the relationship between the back, the arms, and the bar
allows. The lifter’s shoulders will be in front of the bar when it
leaves the ground, and an artificially vertical back angle will decay as
the pull is started, leaving the bar out in front of the shins,
off-balance, with a horizontal displacement to cover before it leaves
the ground. The best position that can be assumed at the start is the
one already described: with the bar over the mid-foot, and the scapulas
directly over the bar. When this alignment exists, the bar is easier to
pull. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Make sure the bar is touching your skin
or your socks before it leaves the floor. It is not necessary to bump
your shins with the bar or to scrape the meat off of them on the way up.
You do need to maintain good control of the weight, because if you
scrape your shins, you can get sores that will be a problem for a long
time; then every time you deadlift, you will break the sore open and
make a big mess on your socks or the bar. You might need to cut a shin
guard out of a one-liter plastic bottle and place it inside the front of
your socks until the sore heals. Sweats help eliminate this scraping
problem, and allow the bar to slide up the thighs better as well.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The knurl of the bar might also be a
problem for your shins if it starts in too close to the middle. A
standard Olympic weightlifting bar and most power bars have an opening
in the knurl that is about 16.5 inches wide, and this is usually
sufficient to accommodate the stance widths of all but the tallest
people. Some bars are manufactured with no thought given to the
possibility that they might someday be used to deadlift. Don’t use these
bars.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Foot placement has been discussed above.
In a deadlift, you are pushing the floor, not lowering the hips as in a
squat, and you must set your stance accordingly. If your stance is too
wide, your legs will either rub your thumbs on the way up or force your
grip out wider to avoid being rubbed. The wider the grip, the farther
the bar has to travel to lock out at the top. The grip and the stance
are interrelated in that your stance must be set to allow the best grip,
and the best grip for the deadlift is one that allows your arms to hang
as straight down from the shoulders as possible when viewed from the
front, i.e. the closest grip possible, in order to make the shortest
possible distance from the floor to lockout for the bar. Too wide a
stance necessitates too wide a grip and confers no mechanical advantage.
If you’re thinking that since we squat with a wider stance, we should
pull with a wider stance, don’t think that. We are not squatting; we are
pushing the floor with the feet, an entirely different thing.

<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Too narrow a stance is not a thing
encountered very often. There have been great deadlifters – Vince Anello
and George Hechter come to mind – who pulled with a very narrow stance,
with heels nearly touching and knees out. This is called a “frog
stance,” and many lifters have used it effectively. We learned the
knees-out position in Step 3 of our deadlift method. In the Squat
chapter, we discussed at length the advantages of externally rotating
the femurs for its effects on depth, the ability to lock the pelvis and
the lower back together, and the stretch reflex (see <a
href="#filepos186178"
class="calibre9">discussion here</a>). This concept is also applicable
in movements – such as starting a pull from the floor – that don’t
elicit a stretch reflex. If a hip extension is involved in the movement,
the lower back obviously needs to be locked with the pelvis and in hard
extension, but what is less obvious is the role of the adductors and
external rotators. If the knees-out position can tighten up the groin
muscles, they can function more effectively as both back-angle anchors
and hip extensors in the pull. Since hip extension is involved in any
pull, a knees-out position can improve the extensors’ participation in
the pull. Olympic weightlifters often employ this knees-out starting
position to fix problems off the floor and to allow for a better back
angle.</span></span></p>

enabled these massively strong men to get more out of their
pulls.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>A more knees-out position also
effectively shortens the distance between the bar and the hips when the
knees are shoved out of the way a little. This modification of the
effective length of the thighs – similar to the effects of a snatch grip
or a sumo stance, where the angle acts to shorten the effective length
of an otherwise fixed segment – makes a more vertical bar path easier to
obtain off the floor. This may be very important for lifters who have
longer femurs and are trying to get into a better start position. (Some
very good competitive deadlifters have learned to use a round upper back
to produce this same shortening of the distance between hips and bar,
producing a better set of pulling mechanics at the hips. This method is
NOT recommended for novices.) But even for lifters with normal
proportions, a little external rotation of the femurs alters the balance
of muscle action around the hips in a positive way, helping to produce a
more effective hip extension off the floor.</span></span></p>

the horizontal distance between knees and hips, with a toes-forward
stance producing a longer moment arm between the hips and the bar, and a
toes-out stance shortening the effective distance and thus the moment
arm. This shortening effect is magnified by the lifter’s widening into
the sumo stance. (</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span

<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>The Little
Details</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Just in case you were thinking that the
deadlift was not rife with picky details, here are a few to
consider.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Breathing is the kind of detail that is
often ignored in lifting instruction. The details of the <a
href="#filepos232685"
class="calibre9">Valsalva maneuver</a> and its importance to spinal
support were discussed in Chapter 2. To implement this procedure for a
pull from the floor, inhale while the bar is on the floor, before you
start the pull, not while you’re supporting a heavy weight at the top.
And exhale after you’re finished with the rep, which happens when the
bar is back on the floor. The top of a deadlift is a poor place to lose
back support, and it is unnecessary since setting the bar down doesn’t
take very long. You can breathe much more safely when the floor is
supporting the bar than you can when your back is supporting the entire
weight at the top.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>A set of deadlifts should start at the
floor, meaning that each rep begins and ends at the bottom, with the
back getting set and a new breath being taken between reps while the bar
is on the floor. Many people like to pull the first rep off of the
floor, breathe at the top at lockout, and finish the set by bouncing the
bar off the floor for the remaining reps. It is easier to do the set
this way, true, but </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">easy</span></span></span><span> and </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">strong</span></span></span><span>
are usually opposing concepts. You need to develop the ability to set
your back and control your position each time you pull the bar, because
these things use precisely the skills and the muscles you are doing this
exercise to develop. The point here, as is so often the case in the
weight room, is not to simply do the deadlifts by moving the barbell
through space, using a deadlift-like movement; the point is to use
deadlifts to get strong by doing them correctly, the way they are best
used to develop strength. They have to be done right, not just done.
</span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Avoiding a
bounce</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>One of the key features of the deadlift
is that it requires the production of force from a dead stop. In
contrast, a key feature of efficient squatting is the use of the
controlled “bounce,” which takes advantage of the stretch reflex that
occurs at the transition between an eccentric and a concentric
contraction. Any muscular contraction is more powerful if it is
immediately preceded by a stretch, as always occurs when you jump. One
of the reasons a heavy deadlift is so brutally hard is that it starts up
out of the bottom without the benefit of the bounce that helps the squat
change the direction of the force from down to up. Up to down without a
bounce is quite a bit harder. If a bounce is incorporated into all the
reps of a set of deadlifts except the first one, much of the value of
doing them is lost. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The energy expended in resetting the
spine into extension and holding it there through the first part of the
pull is a major part of the energy expended during the deadlift. It has
been suggested that if the bar is traveling through the complete ROM of
the deadlift, then all of the work of the deadlift is being done since
the work is being done on the barbell. The </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">work</span></span></span><span> –
defined as force times distance – done against gravity consists of the
vertical distance the bar moves. But the </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">total energy
expended</span></span></span><span> in a deadlift cannot be expressed by
merely calculating the work done on the barbell. The deadlift occurs
within the lifter/barbell system, and force must be produced
isometrically to control the positions of the skeletal components that
transfer the force to the bar. The isometric effort of keeping the
vertebral column rigid for efficient force transfer is obviously
significant; you can miss a heavy deadlift if your low back gets round
and your hips extend before the bar is high enough up your thighs, thus
sabotaging your ability to transfer force to the bar for the top of the
pull. It may be harder to calculate than the simpler
force-times-vertical-distance equation used for the work done on the bar
itself, but no one – or at least no one capable of a truly heavy
deadlift – would argue that the ATP expended in isometric control of the
back is an insignificant contribution to the movement. A set of
“deadlifts” in which the first rep is pulled from a dead stop and the
last reps are bounced is, in reality, one deadlift and a set of RDLs (<a
href="#filepos953291"
class="calibre9">about which more, later</a>). Training this way, you
will never develop the strength needed to hold the lumbar position for
heavy weights, because for 80% of your set you are relying on plate
rebound and the elastic energy stored in the elongating muscles and
fascia, instead of on dead-stop pulling strength. So don’t trade the
ability to develop long-term strength for the immediate gratification
provided by cheating your deadlifts.</span></span></p>

<br />

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure
4-42.</span></span></span><span> The work of the deadlift is understood
to include the force necessary to maintain the correct intervertebral
relationships in lumbar extension, so that the pulling force all gets to
the bar. If you substitute plate-to-platform rebound for the work you
should be doing with your back, you are a
pussy.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Another problem with bouncing your reps
is that any back position problems that develop during the set cannot be
addressed as effectively. If your back begins to round during the set,
it tends to stay round or get worse unless you reset it, which you must
do at the bottom, when the bar is sitting on the floor and your back can
move into the correct position unloaded. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>There are a couple of ways you can think
about setting the back before starting the pull. Positional awareness
has already been discussed, and for some people it is sufficient to
think about arching the lower back. This is, after all, most of what
setting the back is about. But really and truly, you set the entire
torso before you pull, and you may find it helpful to think about it in
this way – squeezing your low back and abs and chest all at the same
time on a big breath, not as separate muscle groups but taken as a whole
unit. This approach increases the effectiveness of the Valsalva and
causes all the muscles participating in it to contract harder and
provide more stability.</span></span></p>

direction</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Eyeball position is also often
overlooked when you assume the starting position. If you look straight
down at the floor when you pull, the bar will usually swing out away
from your legs. It is easier to keep your chest up and your upper back
tight if your eyes are focused on a point that places your neck in an
anatomically neutral position; this point can be on the floor (if you’re
in a big room) or on the wall facing the platform. If the floor is your
gaze point, look about 12–15 feet in front of you. Looking up is not any
better for the deadlift than it is for the squat, as we discussed at
length in that chapter. Actually, looking straight down is not terribly
detrimental to the squat, but it will make the deadlift harder most of
the time. The functions of correct eye gaze direction are to keep the
neck in a safe, useful position during the movement, to aid in placing
the back at the correct angle for the mechanics of the lift, and to
provide a visual reference for balance purposes. Looking up never works
well except in the bench press. </span></span></p>

straight</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Your arms must stay straight during the
deadlift. There is no better way to produce a really lovely elbow injury
than to let 500 pounds straighten out your elbows for you. The physics
of this is not difficult to understand. The force produced by the hips
and legs is transmitted up the rigid torso, across the scapulas, and
down the arms to the bar. Seen from the side, the shoulders will be in
front of the bar and the arms themselves will not be vertical, but they
must be straight. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Just as the back must stay locked to
facilitate force transfer, the elbows must stay straight during this
whole process, too. A bent elbow is a thing that can be straightened
out, if the weight is heavy enough, and the straightening out is done by
force that should have gotten to the bar. Deadlifting with bent elbows
is like towing a car with a spring instead of with a chain: the chain
transfers all the pull to the car, whereas the spring absorbs some of
the force as it changes length. The elbow is flexed by the muscles of
the forearm, the brachialis, and the biceps. If your elbows are bent,
these muscles are working unnecessarily, since they add nothing to the
lift; in fact, bent elbows actually increase the distance the bar has to
travel because they cause the bar to lock out at an unnecessarily higher
position. It is important to convince yourself that your arms are not
involved in the deadlift and that straight elbows are the best way to
pull. This will also be important when you learn how to power clean.

fault of the part of the brain that tells you that “All things must be

to connect the shoulders to the bar; straight arms must be learned early
so that this very bad habit does not become embedded.

<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Finishing the
lift</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Once the bar has completed the trip up
the legs, there are several ways you can finish the deadlift, only one
of them correct. You lock out the bar by lifting your chest and bringing
your knees, hips, and lumbar spine into extension simultaneously. Many
people insist on exaggerating some of these things, performing the
movement inefficiently and, if the exaggerations are carried to the
extreme, unsafely. For example, you don’t need to roll your shoulders up
and back at the top, creating an active concentric shrug. The deadlift
is not finished until the shoulders are back and the chest is up, and
finishing this part of the movement is important. But the traps get
sufficient work from their isometric role in heavy deadlifts without
your attempting to add additional trap work by exaggerating the shrug
and possibly causing a neck injury in the process. Heavy barbell shrugs
are a good assistance exercise for an advanced lifter who knows how to
perform them correctly, but novice deadlifters have no business trying
to add an extra movement to an exercise that is sufficient without it.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Likewise, it is unnecessary and unwise
to exaggerate the hip-extension part of the lockout into a lumbar
overextension (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_008.html#filepos515908"
class="calibre9">Figure 4-45</a>). Since it is virtually impossible to
overextend your hip joints in an upright position with a loaded bar
lying on the anterior side of the thighs, what actually happens is that
you overextend the lumbar spine, sometimes as almost a separate movement
after the deadlift is actually finished. This is a very dangerous habit
to acquire: uneven loading of the lumbar discs is as harmful from the
posterior as it is from the anterior. </span></span></p>

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Knees sometimes get forgotten in the
rush to lock everything out from the hips up. Many contest deadlifts
have been red-lighted because of the lifter’s failure to lock out the
knees. This always produces a flurry of bad language from the lifter
when the lights are explained to him, because anybody who can lock out a
622-pound deadlift can also straighten out his knees the final 5
degrees. Once the deadlift is finished at the top, it requires no more
work – you just have to remember to lock your knees out. Make sure you
are finishing each deadlift with locked knees, and remind yourself
occasionally to check them. This last little movement is an important
part of the lift, even if a powerlifting meet is not the goal of your
training.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Get in the habit of holding the bar
locked out at the top for just a second before you set it down, so that
you achieve a stable position first. If you are in the process of
falling backwards as you attempt to lower the bar, there will be a
significant wreck. The bar should be lowered only after it is locked out
and motionless for just a second, indicating a correctly finished lift
with the bar under control. Don’t exhale; just pause a second and then
set the bar down.</span></span></p>

has forgotten to lock his knees at the top. The fix for this is better

<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Setting the bar down fast in the
deadlift is actually okay. Since the deadlift starts as a concentric
movement, much of its training effect is due to the hard initial
position and the lack of help from a stretch reflex during the lift, as
discussed above. Setting the bar down slowly will make it harder, and
some people might benefit from the extra work, but the emphasis in the
deadlift is on picking up heavy weights. As the weight increases and the
lift gets difficult, upward bar speed will decrease. Setting the bar
down slowly uses up too much gas that could be better used in picking up
your next rep. As long as some modicum of control is exercised, the bar
can be dropped as fast as you are capable of doing safely with your back
in good position according to our previous analysis. Going down fast
with poor control is, of course, hard on your kneecaps and shins. And
depending on the type of plates being used and the nature of the
platform surface, a poorly controlled bounce can cause problems. But in
general, a deadlift can, and usually should, go down faster than it
comes up. </span></span></p>

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>A platform is a good thing to have in
your weight room: use multiple layers of plywood or particle board glued
and screwed together, with rubber mats under the area of plate contact
or the whole thing surfaced with rubber; horse-trailer mats work just
fine and are relatively cheap (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_008.html#filepos521945"
class="calibre9">Figure 4-48</a>). Failing that, rubber mats placed
under the plates on the floor will work, but the room really needs to be
set up correctly for you to train the pulling movements. Bumper plates,
a necessary expense for the clean and the snatch, can be used for the
deadlift as well, but the more reasonably priced ones take up so much
space on the bar (they are very wide) that iron plates will eventually
need to be used as you get stronger. Your gym should be equipped for
this. And if your gym is one of those places that doesn’t allow
deadlifting, find a better gym. Sorry to have to keep saying this, but
there may come a time when your training becomes more important than the
reasons that caused you to originally choose the inadequate facility.
It’s a sign that you’re becoming a lifter. </span></span></p>

<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Straps will be useful on occasion. Use
the kind made from seat belts (it’s probably best not to take the ones
out of your car for this purpose) or some other nylon-type strapping
material, about 1½ inches wide. Cotton will not work, no matter how
thick and strong it looks; it will tear at an inconvenient time. Straps
can be left as simple pieces of material, about two feet long, or the
ends can be tacked together.<br />

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure

seen in the gym. The kind most commonly available commercially
(</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">right</span></span></span><span>) is junk: the design
does not work well, these straps do not last long, they hurt the hands,
and they can break with a heavy weight. The black one in the center has
been in use since 1984 and has never failed.</span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">
</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />
Straps go around your hands, not your wrists. And do not use the kind
with a loop sewn into one end, where the rest of the strap passes
through the loop. They will continue to tighten on your wrists during
the set. Loop-ended straps are never really secure with a heavy weight,
tend to wear out quickly and tear during a heavy set, and never stay in
adjustment on the bar.<br />

wrists.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The position of your belt in a deadlift
might be slightly different from that used in the squat. For
deadlifting, most people seem to prefer to wear the belt a little lower
in the front and a little higher in the back than they do for squatting.
In fact, some people might prefer a different belt altogether, a
thinner, narrower one that allows the deadlift’s start position to be
assumed more easily. The bottom position of the squat is acquired after
the descent under load, while the start position in the deadlift must be
acquired unloaded; a tight belt helps the squat stay together, but for
some people, a tight belt will interfere with squeezing into the start
of a pull. A different, lighter belt may be necessary for deadlifting,
and some people even prefer no belt at all for most pulling if it
prevents a good lumbar set position. Big deadlifts have been pulled with
no belt, and you may find this best for your situation.

<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Finally, the author was a moderately
good deadlifter during his career in the sport and learned many valuable
lessons about strength off the floor during this time. Among them is
that not everybody needs to do heavy deadlifts. People with injured
backs that are prone to re-injury, and people who cannot learn to
perform the movement correctly, don’t need to deadlift with maximum
loads. It’s better if you can, since functional back strength is best
built with functional back work, and the heavier you pull, the stronger
you’ll get. But if you are not powerlifting, you don’t have to do limit
singles. From a training standpoint, there is little to be gained by
doing 1-rep max deadlifts, and your 1RM can be inferred from a 5RM if
obtaining this information is somehow necessary. That having been said,
deadlifts are still the best way to develop useful back strength. Apply
yourself to learning them correctly.</span></span></p>

<hr />
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>There are few gyms left in the world
that don’t have a pressing bench. For good reason: The bench press,
since the 1950s, has become the most widely recognized resistance
exercise movement in the world, the one exercise most representative in
the public mind of barbell training, the exercise the vast majority of
trainees are most likely to want to do, and the exercise most often
asked about by most people if they are interested in how strong you are.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Many incredibly strong men have benched
big weights, long before the advent of modern supportive shirts and even
good benches. Men like Doug Hepburn, Pat Casey, Mel Hennessy, Don
Reinhoudt, Jim Williams (who lifted in excess of 700 pounds in a thin,
cheap, white T-shirt), and Ronnie Ray were strong back in the early days
of powerlifting, although the weights they lifted would, sad to say,
scarcely turn a head at a 21st-century national meet. Accomplished
powerlifters of the 1980s – men like Larry Pacifico, the incredible Mike
McDonald, George Hechter, John Kuc, Mike Bridges, Bill Kazmaier, Rickey
Dale Crain, and the late, great Doug Young – were masters of the bench
press, using all the tricks at their disposal to establish national and
world records in the lift (<a

<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The modern version of the bench press,
like the squat, depends on an additional piece of equipment other than
the bar for its execution. Until the upright support bench came into
widespread use in the 1950s, the lifter had to lie on the floor and pull
the bar into position, or lie on a flat bench and pull the bar up from
the floor, over the head, and into position over the chest. Controversy
abounded as technique was evolving, with questions about the legitimacy
of assistance in getting the bar into position, the use of a heave from
the belly, and even the use of an arch in the lower back, causing debate
among physical culturists all over the world. Nowadays, the bench-press
bench – the upright-support bench, as opposed to the plain flat bench –
is standard gym equipment, and only a few innovative thinkers in the
powerlifting community bother with doing the exercise the old, harder,
and probably better way. After all, the more involved the exercise, the
more the exercise involves in terms of muscle, nerve, and control.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The dumbbell version of the exercise,
which actually predates the barbell version due to its less specialized
equipment requirements, involves a greater amount of instability, which
is inherent in having two separate chunks of metal waving around in the
air over your chest. This is especially true if the weights used are
sufficiently heavy to challenge your ability to actually finish the set.
Most trainees use dumbbell bench presses as a light assistance movement,
and never appreciate how hard they are or how useful they can be at
heavy weights. They are performed on a simple flat bench, and the lifter
has to take the dumbbells out of the rack or off the floor, get into
position on the flat bench, do the set, and then get off the bench with
them after finishing it. These movements are as large a part of the
exercise as is getting to look at your arms in the mirror. Because
dumbbells are not tied together between the hands as a barbell is,
dumbbell bench presses require more active, conscious control, are
harder to do, and are therefore less commonly done. The problem with
dumbbell bench presses is that the equipment provides its own
limitations in a progressively increasing program. Most dumbbell racks
are not graduated in fine-enough increments due to the expense of having
twice as many dumbbells as most gyms have the money or space for.
Plate-loaded dumbbell handles that would permit such loading are not
widely available, of sufficient quality that they are safe at heavy
weights, or capable of being handled without a lot of help from two
spotters. And with heavy weights, getting on and off the bench becomes
such a large part of the task of completing the set that the logistics
are a giant pain in the ass. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>So, as good an exercise as the dumbbell
bench may be, you will be bench pressing with a barbell, as the weight
of history and precedent demands. The bench press, or supine press (one
occasionally sees old references to the “prone press” in badly edited
sources), is a popular, useful exercise. It is arguably the best way to
develop raw upper-body strength, and done correctly, it is a valuable
addition to your strength and conditioning program.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The bench press actively trains the
muscles of the anterior shoulder girdle and the triceps, as well as the
forearm muscles, the upper back, and the lats. The primary movers are
the pectoralis major and the anterior deltoid, which drive the bar up
off the chest, and the triceps, which drive the elbow extension to
lockout. The bigger posterior muscles – the trapezius, the rhomboideus,
and other smaller muscles along the cervical and thoracic spine – act
isometrically to adduct the shoulder blades and keep the back stable
against the bench. The pectoralis minor helps stabilize the rib cage
into the arched position when the scapulae are anchored by the traps and
rhomboids. The posterior rotator cuff muscles stabilize and prevent the
rotation of the humerus during the movement. The lats, or latissimus
dorsi muscles, rotate the rib cage up, arched relative to the lower
back, thereby decreasing the distance the bar has to travel and adding
to the stability of the position. They also act as a counter to the
deltoids, preventing the elbows from adducting, or rising up toward the
head, while the humerus is driving up out of the bottom, thus preventing
the angle between the upper arm and torso from changing during the lower
part of the range of motion. The muscles of the lower back, hips, and
legs act as a bridge between the upper body and the ground, anchoring
and stabilizing the chest and arms as they do the work of handling the
bar. And the neck muscles contract isometrically to stabilize the
cervical spine – hopefully not while pressing too hard against the bench
with the back of the head. Yes, bench pressing makes your neck grow,
too, making new dress shirts inevitable. Since the bench press is a
free-weight exercise, control of the bar is integral to the movement,
and improvement in control is part of the benefit of doing it.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>You will be using standard power bars
and benches for the bench press. Standard power bars are widely
available, and this configuration has proven itself as the most useful
over the years for general-purpose gym use. It is probably the type that
will be most available to you, at your gym or to buy for a reasonable
price, Olympic weightlifting bars being quite a bit more expensive. The
specifications are simple: the bar diameter should be 28 to 29 mm; the
length is about 7 feet 2.5 inches; and the knurling should be adequate
but not too sharp, and will extend in from the sleeves so that a
16.5-inch gap is left in the middle, with center knurling of 4.5 to 6
inches provided. The knurling will be scored with a ring at either end
of the bar, with a distance of 32 inches between the marks, denoting the
maximum legal grip width for competition. If standard power bars are not
available, use what you have until better equipment can be obtained. If
you have to use a non-standard bar, be familiar with its marking
dimensions so that you can correctly apply the instructions for grip
dimensions. Bars are absolutely the wrong place to save money, either
when you buy one or when your gym does (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_009.html#filepos539898"

<br />

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure 5-2.</span></span></span><span>
Bars for weight training can be obtained from several sources. “Power”
bars are best for our purposes here because they are marked in ways that
are the most useful for the exercises that constitute the bulk of this
program. High-quality bars have uniform dimensions and similar
mechanical characteristics, but there are differences that should be
evaluated before you buy one. Subtle differences in diameter and tensile
characteristics make some bars better for certain applications than
others: whippier bars are better for cleans and presses, and stiffer
bars are better for squats, benches, and
deadlifts.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The benches should also conform to
standard specs, although there is no standard configuration for
constructing them. Standard specifications require the height of the
bench surface to be 17 inches, and if this is too tall for short
trainees, then blocks for the lifter’s feet (or usually just barbell
plates) will need to be provided. Uprights can be either fixed or
adjustable, with a distance of about 45 inches between the uprights. Or
you can use the power rack and a 17-inch flat bench for the bench press
station (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_009.html#filepos544019"
class="calibre9">Figure 5-3</a>). Most benches are provided with some
type of vinyl upholstery, but auto seat fabric has proven itself over
the years to last longer and provide better traction for the back during
the lift. Benches – both upright support and flat benches – seem to have
been the victim of manufacturing stupidity for the past several decades.
A commercial gym should invest in standard competition bench press
equipment, for safety as well as for training and competition
consistency. Benches are a stupid place to save money,
too.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Learning to Bench
Press</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>When you’re learning how to bench, it
might be prudent to use a spotter if one is available. Spotting the
bench press will be dealt with in detail later, but for our purposes in
this early phase of learning, a spotter is there to keep the unracking
and racking of the bar safe for the lifter. The leverage disadvantage of
having the bar several inches behind the shoulders is not a problem at
lighter weights, but as the load increases, it becomes one rather
quickly. With the right equipment, i.e., you are working inside a
correctly set-up power rack, a spotter is not absolutely necessary. Even
on an open bench, you are using very light weights during the learning
phase, and you should not have enough weight on the bar to give a
spotter anything to do. A bad spotter who will not stay out of your way
while you train is actually a detriment and can quite often cause more
problems for you than he can prevent. If you are just learning to bench
and you’re worried about your ability to handle the bar, you have too
much weight on it. If a 45-pound bar is too heavy – as it might be in
your particular circumstances – use a lighter bar. If you are concerned,
use a spotter, but make sure to use an experienced, competent, patient
individual who will not insist on “helping” you just for the sake of
participating in your exercise program. If you are forced to use an
inexperienced spotter, explain as thoroughly as possible the specifics
of the job, described in detail at the end of this

Three ways to use equipment for the bench press. (A) The upright-support
bench is preferred by most lifters, but the power rack (B) offers
adjustability and a better use of space and limited resources. (C) It
also allows you to safely train the bench press without a
spotter.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>As usual, start with an empty bar.
ALWAYS start every lift with an empty bar, whether learning the lift for
the first time or warming up for a personal record. Lie down on the
bench with your eyes looking straight up. In this position, you should
be far enough down (“down” always meaning toward the foot end of the
bench) from the bar that when you look up, your eyes are focused on the
down side of the bar (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_009.html#filepos545467"
class="calibre9">Figure 5-4</a>). This means just a short distance, not
several inches, which would increase the difficulty of getting the bar
unracked.<br />

<br />
<br />
Your feet should be flat on the ground in a comfortable spacing
comparable to the squat stance, with your shins approximately vertical.
Your upper back should be flat against the bench, with your lower back
in an anatomically normal arched position – at first. We’ll modify the
back arch later.<br />

<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>After getting into position, take an
overhand grip on the bar. Your grip should be somewhere between 22 and
24 inches, measured between the index fingers; the variation is based on
differences in shoulder width. This grip width will produce a vertical
forearm for most people when the bar is on the chest, a position that
produces the most range of motion around the shoulder joint during the
movement. The bar should rest on the heel of your palm (not up near the
fingers), and directly over the bones of the forearm, so that power
being transmitted up the arms and to the bar goes directly to the bar
without being channeled through the wrists. Wrap your fingers around the
bar AFTER you have set it correctly on the heels of your hands. This
grip is best accomplished by pronating your hands, with a slight
internal rotation of your arms. </span></span></p>

<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>You are now ready to take the bar out of
the rack. Look directly up at the ceiling, above your position on the
bench, and push up on the bar, locking out your elbows. With elbows
locked, move the bar out to a position directly over the line of your
shoulder joints – the </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">glenohumeral joints</span></span></span><span> – to place
your arms in a perfectly vertical position relative to the joints and
thus to the floor. Don’t stop before you get the bar over your chest,
because if you do, the bar will be over your chin or throat. Make sure
the bar gets out to the place it needs to be, right over the joint. This
is the place where the bar is in balance at lockout, where there is no
moment arm between the bar and the fulcrum that is the shoulder joint.
Move the bar to this position quickly and without hesitation, with your
elbows locked out the entire time. Your spotter can help you do this the
first few times, just making sure the bar clears your face and neck and
gets all the way out over your chest. </span></span></p>

</span></span></span><span> The bar is in balance when it is vertically
aligned with the glenohumeral joints. Any horizontal distance between
the bar and the balance point represents a moment arm that must be
worked against. The distance between the rack and the start position is
a significant moment arm at heavy weights, and the spotter’s job is to
help the lifter deal with this bad mechanical position.

<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>As the bar becomes stable in the lockout
position, look at the very important picture directly overhead. You will
be staring at the ceiling directly above the bar, and the ceiling with
the bar in the foreground will comprise your entire field of vision.
This picture is your reference for the path the bar will take as you
move it down and up. You will see the bar against the ceiling in the
lower half of your field of vision. Look at the bar’s position relative
to the features you see on the surface of the ceiling. Don’t look at the
bar; look at the ceiling and just </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">see</span></span></span><span>
the bar. Move the bar a tiny bit. Notice that if the bar moves even a
little, you can tell by the change it makes against the ceiling. The bar
moves and the ceiling does not, and the ceiling is therefore your
position reference for the bar. </span></span></p>

class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure 5-8.</span></span></span><span>
View from the trainee’s position on the bench. The position of the bar
is referenced against the ceiling. Note the focus; the eyes look at the
ceiling, not at the bar.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Note carefully the position of the bar
against the ceiling. You will lower the bar to your chest, touch the
chest, and then drive the bar right back to exactly the same position.
Stare at the place on the ceiling where the bar is to go. DO NOT look at
the bar as it moves; do NOT follow the bar with your eyes, but just
stare at the ceiling. You are going to make the bar go to that place
every rep.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>With the bar locked out over the
shoulders, have your spotter touch your chest a few inches below
(inferior to) the bar’s vertical position, at about the middle of your
sternum. Have him push hard enough that you can feel it after he takes
the finger away. This tactile cue will quite effectively identify the
point on your chest to touch the bar. If there is no spotter and you are
benching alone inside a rack, unlock your elbows straight out to the
sides and then allow them to drop towards your feet a little on the way
down. Just a little. If you do this correctly, the net effect will be
the same as the spotter’s touch – the bar will contact your sternum a
few inches below your clavicles, and therefore below your shoulder
joints. Note that the precise position the bar should contact the
sternum will vary with the chest up position of the lifter on the bench,
but the middle of the sternum, a few inches below the clavicles, is a
good place to start. The goal here is to produce a bar path that is not
vertical, for reasons which will be discussed in detail later.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>With this in mind, look at the ceiling,
unlock your elbows, lower the bar to the chest, touch it without
stopping, and drive the bar back at the point on the ceiling your eyes
have trapped. Try it for a set of five reps. You’ll notice immediately
that if your eyes don’t move from their fixed position, the bar will go
to the same place every rep.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>This little eyeball trick works 90% of
the time the first time it is used to produce a correct bench-press bar
path. Even if you are “poorly coordinated,” you should be able to do a
fairly good bench press within a couple of sets by using this technique.
“The groove,” as the bar path is often referred to by bench pressers, is
the first and most frustrating problem that novice trainees will
experience because the tendency is to follow the bar with your eyes. By
focusing your eyes on the ceiling, you can eliminate this problem the
vast majority of the time. If the bar finds the groove automatically, as
it does with this method, you can direct your attention to other aspects
of the exercise that might be a problem.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The key to the whole method is staring
at the fixed position and not at the moving bar. If you use a fixed
reference point for the bar position, you can make the bar go to the
same place – and therefore through the same path – each rep. If you
follow the bar with your eyes, you have no way to direct the bar to the
same place every time because you are looking at the thing you are
moving and not at the place you want it to go. This is the same
principle used to hit a golf ball or a tennis ball: the implement moves
to the target (the ball), and the target is the object of the fixed eye
gaze. Granted, tennis balls move and golf balls don’t (until they’re
hit), but the principle is the same. The brain coordinates the hands to
take the implement – the club, racquet, pool cue, or bat, or the sword,
sledgehammer, axe, or barbell – to the target, because the target is the
reference for the eyes. When a tennis ball moves, the head and eyes move
with it, rendering it a stationary point. Fortunately, most ceilings
don’t move in most weight rooms, so our task is easier than McEnroe’s,
but it is similar in that we are driving an object in our hands toward a
stationary thing we are actively looking at. There are similarities
between seemingly diverse activities, all of which involve movement
directed by the eyes. Whether the object of the movement is stationary
or in motion, the implement in the hands goes where the eye gaze is
focused.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Do another set of five with the bar,
reinforcing your eye position, and then rack the bar. This is done with
locked elbows, after the last rep is finished, by moving the bar back to
the uprights, touching them with the bar, and then setting it down in
the hooks. Should you have a spotter, this movement back to the rack
should be covered. For the next sets of five reps, add weight a little
at a time – 10 pounds at a time for smaller kids and women, 20 or even
30 pounds for bigger trainees – until the bar speed begins to slow down
and your form starts to change. Stay there for two more sets of five,
and that is the first workout. </span></span></p>

<br />

<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Common Problems
Everyone Should Know How to Solve</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Since the bench press is the most
popular exercise in the weight room, lots of people do it. Since lots of
people do it, lots of people teach it, and lots of extremely wrong ways
to teach it have been developed over the years – things that make
absolutely no mechanical sense, some of which are quite dangerous. The
bench press is already the most dangerous exercise in the world due to
the position of the body between the bar and bench, with no way to get
the bar off of you by yourself in the event of an accident. Normally we
let safety follow as the logical by-product of efficiency, but for the
bench press, we’ll pay extra attention to ways to avoid getting killed
under the bar. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Hands and
grip</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The bar, being over the head, face, and
neck during the bench press, presents some significant safety problems
if certain common-sense precautions are not observed. The subject of
spotters and spotting will be dealt with in detail later, so these
comments will involve things that </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">you</span></span></span><span>
must do. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Maybe the biggest, dumbest, most common
problem involving the hands is the use of the thumbless grip.
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="bold">Except for the
squat, there is no thumbless grip in barbell
training.</span></span></span><span> Using a thumbless grip is
absolutely the worst decision you can make with regard to safety, and it
is detrimental to performance as well. Many lifters start with a
thumbless grip in an attempt to get the bar over the very end of the
arms, with the leverage off of the wrists, which is understandable. But
doing this with a thumbless grip is unnecessary since the same position
can be obtained with the thumbs hooked around the bar . The risk of
having an unsecured bar over the face and throat is just too high. The
grip is thumbless in the squat because the bar is not moving – you are.
For the bench press, the thumbs secure the bar in your grip, and without
your thumbs around the bar, it is merely balanced over the end of your
arms. </span></span></p>
<br />
<span class="calibre1"></span>
<p><span class="calibre7"><img src="./images/00326.jpg" class="calibre8"
alt="379-WFAC.tif" /> <img src="./images/00327.jpg" class="calibre8"

<br />

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure 5-10.
</span></span></span><span> </span> (A) The thumbless grip vs. (B) the
thumbs-around grip. There are only a few ways to get badly hurt in the
weight room, and using the thumbless grip is one of them. You can get
the same position over the end of the arm with the thumbs-around grip,
without the potential risk of dropping the bar on your face, throat, or
chest.</span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The best spotter in the world cannot
react quickly enough to save you from a dropped bar. The danger of this
cannot truly be appreciated until one sees the effects of a dropped bar
firsthand. In the United States every year, an average of eleven people
are killed while training with weights, </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">essentially all of them under the
bench press</span></span></span><span>. While this means that millions
of lifters are doing perfectly safe bench presses, you still don’t want
to be one of the eleven who weren’t. If you insist on using a thumbless
grip on the bench, you need to do it at home so that when the ambulance
comes (if anyone is there to call 911), it doesn’t disrupt anyone else’s
training.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Another problem with the thumbless grip
is that it diminishes lifting efficiency: what the hands cannot squeeze,
the shoulders cannot drive as efficiently. This phenomenon can be
observed when you’re using large-diameter bars and fat-handled
dumbbells: a 2-inch bar is about twice as hard to press as a standard
28.5mm (1 1/8 inch) bar. This difference is due to the inability of a
person with a normal-size hand to effectively squeeze a fat bar with a
good tight grip. Squeezing involves closing the thumb and fingers around
the bar until effective pressure can be applied with the forearm muscles
in isometric contraction, increasing the tightness of the muscles on the
distal side of the elbow, making rebound out of the bottom more
efficient, and increasing motor unit recruitment throughout the arms and
upper body. (Distal is the end furthest from the center of the body, and
proximal is the closest to it.) Some lifters like to think about leaving
their fingerprints in the knurl of the bar to increase their squeeze.
The thumbless grip is an excellent way to voluntarily reduce the
lifter’s ability to squeeze the bar. Try it yourself for demonstration
purposes, with a light weight, please. Many big benches have been done
with a thumbless grip, just like many big squats have been done with
less-than-perfectly-efficient technique; some people get very good at
doing things inefficiently. The point is that since the standard grip is
safer </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">and</span></span></span><span> more effective, it should
be used by everybody who has thumbs.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The thumbless grip is an attempt, as
previously stated, to get the bar into a better position in the hands.
The force generated by the shoulders and triceps is delivered to the bar
through the bones of the forearms. The most efficient transmission of
power to the bar would be directly from the heels of the palms to the
bar, through the forearms positioned vertically, directly under the bar,
so that no moment arm exists between the wrists and the bar. Most people
look at the bar, see the line of the bar in the air over their eyes, and
then place their hands in a position that puts the knuckles in a
parallel line with the bar. This position will produce a distance of 1–2
inches between the bar and the wrist – resulting in a lot of unnecessary
leverage against the joint, and an inefficient force transmission
configuration. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>As discussed in the press chapter, the
best way to position the grip efficiently is to set the grip width at
the index finger and then rotate the hands into pronation by pointing
the thumbs down toward the feet. This motion aligns the bar with the
“radial longitudinal crease” and between the “thenar eminence” (the high
spot adjacent to the thumb) and the medial palmar (“hypothenar”)
eminence on the other side (see <a
href="#filepos320882"
class="calibre9">Figure 3-10</a>). Then, just lay your fingers down on
the bar and squeeze the fingertips into the bar. When you take it out of
the rack, the bar will be on the heels of your palms, directly over your
forearm bones, as shown in <a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_009.html#filepos566436"
class="calibre9">Figure 5-11</a>.<br />

<br />

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure 5-11.
</span></span></span><span>Most people will begin and end the grip
process with the bar lying perpendicular to the line of the knuckles
(A). The best position is achieved by rotating the hands into pronation
(B), and then setting the grip (C). Note the position of the bar in
relation to the hand.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />
This position hooks your thumbs around the bar and removes the wrists
from the kinetic chain. Once your hands are in position, tighten your
palms so that the bar is well supported and does not move during the
rep. The thumbs do not interfere with this process at all. You don’t
need the bar down in your fingers, the same way you hold it in a
deadlift, since gravity is not trying to pull it out of your fingers. In
the bench press and press, the bar is in compression in your hands, not
tension. Carrying your deadlift grip habits into the bench press and the
press is just not productive.
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>It is common for the bar to shift back
in your hand, toward the fingers, during the set, so that the bar ends
up in a completely different position from where it started. This is the
result of not maintaining a tight grip during the set. If the bar shifts
much at all, it can change the lifting mechanics by altering the
position of the load relative to the muscles driving it up, making a
change in elbow or shoulder position during the lift likely. If the bar
rolls back in the hands, it has also rolled back relative to the elbows
and shoulders, and they have to adjust to maintain their drive. The bar
should remain locked firmly in place during the set for efficiency and
safety.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Grip width, within a certain range, is
largely a matter of individual preference. Since you are trying to
develop general upper-body strength, your form should be generalized,
without too much emphasis on any one muscle group and with a lot of work
for all of them. The greatest range of motion is obtained with a grip
that places the forearms in a vertical position when the bar is on the
chest. With a wider grip, the bar doesn’t move as far and locks out
before the triceps have done much work, so the pecs and delts end up
doing more of what work gets done. But as long as the grip falls
somewhere between 22 and 28 inches between index fingers, the purpose is
served. This range allows enough leeway for people of all shoulder
widths to find a grip they feel strongest with, while preserving the
longer range of motion. Too much narrower a grip will, for most people,
take pounds off the work set by placing the responsibility for most of
the lockout on the comparatively smaller triceps, although most lifters
can close-grip a fairly high percentage of their standard-grip bench
press. A wider grip shortens the range of motion excessively and takes
out too much tricep, as well as producing a longer moment arm between
the hand and the shoulder joint. Heavier weights can be benched with a
wide grip since the bar doesn’t have to move as far (the legal width for
powerlifting competition is 32 inches between index fingers).

<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>But we are trying to make people strong
by using the bench press, which isn’t necessarily the same thing as
making people bench a heavier weight. Most people will self-select a
medium grip when they first do the exercise anyway. It feels more
natural than a wide grip, which must be practiced extensively before it
will be productive. A medium grip gives all the muscles of the shoulder
girdle a share of the work and produces the kind of overall shoulder and
arm strength we want from the exercise.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="calibre5"><span
class="bold"><span>Elbows</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>An understanding of elbow position is
essential for lifting efficiency and, once again, safety. The elbow
joint is at the distal end of the humerus, as it articulates with the
radius and the ulna. The bony knob on the end of the ulna that most
people think of as “the elbow” is the olecranon process, to which the
triceps tendon is attached. The pecs and delts attach to the anterior
side of the humerus up by the shoulder. Essentially, all the force being
generated by the muscles involved in the bench press moves the elbow
down and up, and the forearm parallel to the bar with elbow directly
underneath the bar so that no moment force develops between the bar and
the elbow. The action around the shoulder joint contributes to the
movement of the elbow, but the shoulder doesn’t – or at least shouldn’t
– change its position against the bench while the humerus is moving.
Think of it as if the elbows move and the shoulders do not (even though
this is not literally true).</span></span></p>
<br />
<span class="calibre1"></span>

</span></span></span><span> The forearm must be vertical from all angles
to ensure optimum force transmission to the bar and to ensure that no
rotational force is generated. </span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The position of the humerus while it
moves the bar is crucial to the success of the movement. This position
is determined by the angle the humerus makes with the torso as it
proceeds from the lockout position down to the chest and back, as seen
from above. The bar starts at the lockout position directly over the
shoulder joint. In this position, there is no moment arm between bar and
pivot point – the bar is in balance, with no effort being expended to
keep it there other than keeping the upper arms and the forearms locked
in a straight column of support. At the bottom – on the chest – a
humerus angle of 90 degrees to the torso, a position of complete
“abduction,” would have the upper arms at right angles to the bench,
parallel to the bar, with the bar directly over the shoulder joints. If
mechanical considerations were our only concern, this would be the ideal
bottom position because it would produce a mechanically ideal bar path,
with zero moment between bar and joint through the whole range of
motion, and zero force to apply on any leverage between bar and
shoulder.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>But mechanical considerations are not
our only concern. We need to be able to train the bench press without
injuring our shoulders. Shoulder surgery is a GREAT BIG DEAL, I assure
you. This makes anatomical considerations very important in an analysis
of bench press mechanics.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The press is never a problem for
shoulder health because when you are standing, the scapulas are free to
rotate up and in toward the spine as you drive the bar up. This allows
the scapular position to accommodate the humerus locked in line with the
forearm, so that there is no impingement between the bony knobs on the
lateral scapula – the acromion and coracoid processes – and the rotator
cuff and bicep tendons. The scapula gets out of the way of the humerus
because it can “float” into a position that doesn’t hurt anything (<a
href="#filepos305923"
class="calibre9">Figure 3-5</a>). In fact, the scapula is pulled out of
the way by the trapezius muscle as the bar is shrugged into lockout.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>In contrast, the bench press position
traps the scapulas under the rib cage into a solid platform against the
bench as the chest is shoved up and the back is arched. The scapulas are
adducted – pinched together or retracted. They do not move if the
position is assumed correctly, because they are functioning as the
interface between the body and the bench. Therefore, they cannot
accommodate the humerus if it approaches the bony processes. Since the
scapula cannot adjust to accommodate the humerus, the humerus must
accommodate the scapula by staying out of the way of the bony processes
so that they don’t saw a hole through the rotator cuff tendons.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The lifter keeps the scapulas out of the
way by lowering the elbows, and thus the humerus, from 90 degrees of
abduction to about 75 degrees. This shift allows the humerus to travel
from lockout down to a position that permits the bar to touch the chest
– the longest range of motion that can be made with a straight bar – and
back to lockout without approaching a position that would impinge the
shoulder. But as mentioned earlier, there are mechanical considerations.

cause shoulder impingement. </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span

<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The most mechanically efficient bar path
would be one in which the bar traveled vertically down and up directly
over the shoulder joints, with the elbows at 90 degrees of abduction.
But since this would impinge the shoulders, we must tolerate some
inefficiency in the form of a non-vertical bar path produced by the
distance the bar travels down the chest as the elbows are lowered from
90 degrees of abduction. This non-vertical bar path creates a moment arm
between the bar and the shoulder joints at the bottom of the movement;
this moment arm is equivalent to the distance along the sagittal plane
between the bar and the shoulder joints. The farther the elbows are
allowed to drop out of abduction – i.e., the lower the bar is along the
chest – the longer the moment arm is against the shoulder joints. The
bar follows the elbows: if they rotate away from the ribs, the bar goes
up the chest toward the throat, and if the elbows move toward the rib
cage, the bar moves down toward the belly (<a

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure 5-15.
</span></span></span><span> The upper arm angle determines the point
where the bar will touch the chest. The lower the elbows, the lower the
bar, and high elbows put the bar close to the throat. The moment arm is
the distance between the bar and the shoulder joints, and it varies with
the elbow position. (</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">M.A. = moment
arm</span></span></span><span>)</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Your elbow position is therefore related
to the bar position and to your individual anthropometry. For example,
an experienced, proficient lifter with good upper back flexibility can
arch his chest up high, thus allowing the bar a shorter trip down and
up. This technique will have the bar touching lower on the chest, toward
the bottom of the sternum, as the rib cage rotates up. For a person with
less flexibility in the upper spine, this bar position on the chest
would require the elbows to be at an angle of perhaps 45 degrees to the
torso, about halfway between touching the rib cage and in line with the
shoulders. But since our experienced, flexible lifter has his chest up
higher, his shoulders are closer horizontally to the bottom of his
sternum, when viewed from the side. This effect is due to the steeper
angle that his flexibility allows his upper back, and thus his chest, to
attain. This steep chest angle allows his elbows to stay more in line
with his shoulders than they would for a less flexible
trainee.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>More important, as the chest rotates up,
the shoulder joint rotates into a position more in line with the bar on
the chest when the humerus is in the preferred 75 degrees of abduction.
This rotation returns some verticality to the bar path and some
mechanical efficiency to the movement by reducing the distance – and
thus the moment arm – between the bar and the shoulder joint (<a

chest, you can recover the mechanical efficiency of a short moment arm
by squeezing the chest up and rotating the shoulder joints back up under
the bar. Doing this makes the bar path more vertical and shorter at the
same time.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The correct humeral angle can actually
vary quite a bit among individual lifters, from 75 to perhaps 45 degrees
depending on the flexibility of the upper back and the ability to
produce a high arch. Some lifters use an elbow position where the
humerus is essentially parallel to the torso, placing the bar quite a
distance down the chest from the shoulders. This position produces an
obviously very long moment arm between the bar and the shoulder, as well
as a humeral angle that eliminates most of the pecs’ function from the
movement, reducing the muscle mass involved and the efficiency of the
lift as an exercise for the whole upper body. This technique works well
for powerlifters wearing a bench press shirt that does much of the work
off the chest for the lifter, but for general strength training
purposes, it is not useful.</span></span></p>

<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The chest, for bench pressing purposes,
is the anterior rib cage and the muscles attached to it. The main chest
muscles – the pectoralis majors, or pecs – attach to the humerus at a
long insertion point along the upper third of the bone. They wrap across
the rib cage to a long origin along a line from the bottom of the
sternum, up to the clavicle, and along the clavicle two-thirds of the
way back to its distal end at the shoulder, with the muscle fibers
fanning out in a broad angle. The frontal deltoids attach with the rest
of the deltoid muscle at the deltoid tuberosity, a bump on the lateral
aspect of the humerus, almost halfway down the shaft of the bone. The
delts fan back into the shoulder and attach to the distal one-third of
the clavicle in front and to the spine of the scapula in back. This wide
angle of origin allows the pec and delt muscles to apply force to the
humerus over a range of angles of insertion, thus permitting a range of
effective elbow positions in the bench press. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>It is important to understand the
relationship between the pectoralis major and anterior deltoid muscle
attachments to the humerus and the angle of those attachments. Viewed
from the horizontal (a cross-section of your chest perpendicular to your
spine), the pec/delt attachments occur at an angle that varies with
chest position. Refer to <a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_009.html#filepos586362"
class="calibre9">Figure 5-17</a>. The higher the top of the chest – the
highest point on the rib cage above the bench – the steeper the angle
with which the pecs and delts attach to the humerus. The steeper the
angle, the better, because of the increased mechanical efficiency of the
contraction caused by the steeper angle of attack on the humerus. A
lever system exhibits greater efficiency as the force gets closer to
being perpendicular to the moment arm. So the higher the chest position
above the arms, the better the pull the pecs and delts have on the arms.
This effect is in addition to the mechanical improvement that the
chest-up position produces in the previously discussed bar/shoulder
relationship. The short version: keep your chest up high when you bench.

or genetics – increases bench press efficiency. The increased steepness
of the angle of attack of upper fibers of the pec and delt on the
humerus increases the efficiency of the pull against the bone. This
characteristic of levers explains one of the advantages to be obtained
by increased bodyweight and is what is meant by the term “leverage.” It
applies throughout the barbell exercises.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>No discussion of the bench press would
be complete without an explanation of the function of the lats in the
movement. The latissimus dorsi muscles get implicated in a lot of bench
pressing methods, but it is necessary to look at their actual function
to assess their contribution to the movement. The lats have a very broad
origin on the lower back, from T7 down across the thoracolumbar fascia
to the iliac crest, covering the area of the entire lower back. This
broad origin turns into a large flat muscle belly that inserts by means
of a thick, flat tendon on the </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">anterior</span></span></span><span> medial side of the
humerus, parallel to the pec tendon insertion under the armpit. The
action of the lat is thus the opposite of the pec’s action – the lat
pulls the humerus back while the pec pulls it forward. That’s why
chin-ups train the lats, and bench presses train the pecs.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>But if this is the case, what function
could the lats possibly have in the bench press? They can’t make the bar
go forward (up), because when they contract, they pull it backward
(down). A case could be made for a large lat muscle belly providing a
rebound surface for the tricep as it approaches the bottom. But it is
more logical that the contracted lat provides further reinforcement for
the chest-up position, since a contracted lat would pull the lower back
toward the shoulder, if permitted to do so, and would be aided by the
other muscles that establish the arched position on the bench. The lats
contribute to the bench press, but they don’t do it by making the bar go
up, because they can’t. They just help keep the chest up, a very
important function, as we have seen (<a

<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>A common problem that could be
considered chest-related is the failure to touch the chest with the bar
at the bottom of every rep. Sometimes this is accidental, if you intend
to touch but miss. If this is the case, you’ll get it on the next rep,
and the error will happen accidentally only the first couple of times
you bench. But don’t play games with the weight on the bar by failing to
do a complete rep on purpose. It is, after all, easier to move a load a
shorter distance than a longer distance, and when you cut it short, you
are just lifting more weight at the expense of moving the bar through
the whole range of motion. Work equals the force of gravity acting on
the barbell multiplied by the vertical distance the barbell moves. If,
over the course of three months’ training, the barbell doubles in weight
but is traveling only half the distance it did on the first day of
training, the work has stayed the same and you have wasted three months
on training a partial ROM. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Sometimes a partial bench press may be
done on purpose. There is a school of thought that justifies the use of
less than a full range of motion by claiming that the pecs stop
contributing to the movement when the humerus reaches a 90-degree angle
with the forearm. (This same “analysis” requires an above-parallel squat
because the quads supposedly stop contributing when the femur gets to 90
degrees with the tibia.) The problem with this model is that
full-range-of-motion, multi-joint exercises are not supposed to isolate
any one muscle. We use them precisely because they don’t do that. We
want these exercises to train lots of muscles through a long range of
motion. We like it when some muscles are called into function as other
muscles drop out of function, and when muscles change their function
during an exercise. This is because we are training for strength, to
increase the force we produce in a big, general </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">movement
pattern</span></span></span><span>; we are not training a “favorite
muscle.” We are not concerned with our favorite muscles. We do not have
favorite muscles. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The use of the full range of motion is
therefore important for two very good reasons. First, it allows you to
quantify the amount of work you do: if you hold the range of motion of
an exercise constant, you are holding constant the distance variable in
your work equation. Then, if the force you can exert on the load
increases (if you lift more weight), you know that your work has
increased for a given number of reps. You know you’re moving the weight
the same distance, and the weight is heavier, so you know you’re
stronger. You can therefore compare performances, both between lifters
and between your own workouts over time. If you touch your chest with
the bar every time you bench, progress – or lack thereof – can be
assessed. This principle obviously applies to every exercise with a
prescribed range of motion. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Second, full-range-of-motion exercises
ensure that strength is developed in every position in which the joints
can operate. Strength development is extremely specific: muscles get
strong in the positions they are made to be strong in, and in precisely
the way they are trained. And motion around a joint is usually composed
of the functions of several muscles working together in changing
relationships as the movement progresses. For instance, a quadriceps
muscle worked through 30 degrees of its range of motion on a leg
extension machine will adapt to this training by improving its ability
to function in that 30 degrees of motion. The muscle will not get much
stronger anywhere else in its range. And all the other muscles involved
in a squat don’t have a chance to get strong if it is performed through
a short ROM, where only the quads work and the other muscles don’t get
called upon to do much. If we want to prepare an athlete to use his legs
for a sport where he might be called upon to use them in a variety of
positions, then he must train through a full range of motion in a way
that strengthens the whole range. Any joint about which movement can
occur will benefit from having its entire function improved. So, all the
muscles that move a joint should be exercised, using a movement that
calls into play as many of the muscles as is efficiently and safely
possible.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The bench press, like the squat,
benefits from a certain amount of rebound out of the bottom, using the
stretch reflex phenomenon that is a feature of skeletal muscle (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_009.html#filepos595619"
class="calibre9">Figure 5-19</a>). It takes practice and good timing to
tighten up the bottom of the movement enough that you can get a correct
rebound every rep, without actually bouncing the bar off your sternum
and rib cage like an object on a trampoline.<br />
<span id="filepos595619"
class="calibre1"></span> </span></span></p>

<br />

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure
5-19.</span></span></span><span> Several physiological and mechanical
phenomena produce a rebound that makes for a stronger contraction.
First, the viscoelastic nature of muscle makes it act like a spring –
the longer you stretch it (up to a certain point), the more forceful the
return. Second, there is an optimal sarcomeric length that results in
the most force being generated by a contraction, and this optimal length
is associated with a mild stretch. Last, the stretch reflex mediated by
muscle spindles (intrafusal fibers) is activated by stretching and
results in a more forceful contraction.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />
A competition bench press (theoretically at least) has no rebound due to
the technical rules, which specify that the bar must cease its motion at
the bottom before being driven up off the chest. A touch-and-go bench
press allows you to lift more weight than a paused bench press. It must
be said that a cheated bench, with a heave of the chest, a hard bounce
off the pecs, and a bridge with the hips, allows more weight to be
lifted than does a strict touch-and-go. Then why is a touch-and-go okay,
but a bounce and a bridge are not? It is not always our objective, as
noted earlier, to lift more weight, but the touch-and-go is easier to
learn than a paused bench because the stretch reflex is such a natural
movement; staying tight at the bottom during the pause is a skill that
is difficult to master even for competitive powerlifters. The bounced,
heaved, bridged, butt-in-the-air version of the bench press uses rib
cage resilience and hip extension to aid in driving the bar up, taking
work away from the targeted muscles. So a strict touch-and-go is a good
compromise, letting you lift more weight but still providing lots of
training for the pressing muscles.
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>You should be able to recognize
excessive bounce and know when a correction needs to be made. For both
the bench press and the squat, optimum bar speed occurs when the bar
moves fast enough to efficiently elicit a stretch reflex and thus permit
an efficient drive up. Bar speed is too slow when the descent produces
fatigue, as it will if you deliberately lift submaximal loads very
slowly. Bar speed is too fast when it actually adds momentum to the load
on the bar on the way down, so that you must decelerate against both the
weight on the bar and the effect of its excessive velocity on that load
– where the effective load on the bar is actually heavier than the
weight. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>You bounce too much when the bar slams
your chest hard enough to change your position with the impact and then
slows down markedly a couple of inches up from your chest. This
excessive bounce occurs because you allowed the downward velocity of the
bar to increase in an attempt to increase mechanical rebound, so the
initial upward velocity of the bar was due more to the physical rebound
than to your active drive off the chest. This means you had to loosen
your position to let the bar speed up as it dropped. If it’s bad enough,
the bar path will change after the rebound as your elbows shift position
from the lack of tightness in your lats and delts. The whole messy thing
is a result of a lack of tightness on the way down, and it can be
remedied in a couple of ways. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>One way to stay tight off the chest is
to just barely touch it. You can’t cheat the rep if you can’t bounce the
bar off your rib cage, and you can’t bounce it if you just barely touch
your chest. Think about touching just your shirt, not your chest, with
the bar. Or you might imagine a piece of glass on your chest that you
have to touch but cannot break. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Visualizing a light touch usually works,
but it deals with symptoms. The best way to fix a bouncing problem is to
address it at its root: by learning to be tight during the movement, and
in a way that can be applied to other lifts as well. It is a way to
conceptualize the lift so that tightness is built in and elastic energy
can be stored in the eccentric (negative) phase for use in the
concentric drive up. The bench press, like the squat, consists of two
movements: lowering the bar and raising the bar. Don’t think about
lowering the bar; just think about </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">driving it
up</span></span></span><span>. As you lower the bar down to your chest,
you should be thinking about driving up hard, not about the descent.
Focus on </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">up</span></span></span><span> only. In an attempt to get
ready for the upward drive, you will slow down the descent and be
tighter as the bar approaches your chest, thus improving your rebound
efficiency and minimizing rib cage bounce. By thinking about driving up
while the bar is on the way down, you will have focused on the thing you
are actually trying to do, at the best point in the movement to start
the process. Lowering the bar is awfully easy, and if you think past
that to the drive, you will slow your descent as you prepare to actively
drive the bar up. This excellent technique works for any exercise with
an initial eccentric component. </span></span></p>

back</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>This important group of muscles has two
functions. First, the upper back needs to be planted firmly against the
bench and used as a platform to drive against while the arms drive the
bar up. When this is done correctly, the shoulder blades will be
adducted, or pulled together, to make a flat spot on the upper back to
push against the bench itself. This stable platform is the anatomical
surface against which the kinetic chain begins. Stated another way, when
you bench press, you drive the bench and the bar apart – the bar moves
and the bench doesn’t, but you push against both (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_009.html#filepos603324"
class="calibre9">Figure 5-20</a>). The upper back and shoulders push
against the bench, and they need to be tight while doing so, just as the
hands are tight against the bar. Second, the shoulders in their adducted
position, and the upper back muscles as they contract and rotate or
“tilt” the upper back into a chest-up position, push the rib cage up and
hold the chest higher above the bench. This approach increases the
mechanical efficiency of the pec/delt contraction by steepening the
angle of attack on the humerus, as discussed earlier.</span></span></p>

</span></span></span><span>Just as we do when climbing a chimney (it
still happens occasionally, really), when benching, we are in between
and pushing against two opposing things. When we are benching, the bar
moves and the bench does not.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Keeping your back tight is sometimes a
difficult thing to do, since so many other things are going on at the
same time. So it needs to be learned in such a way that it requires
little active attention. Think about the “driving against the bench”
model and why you need your chest up. Then sit on the bench in the same
position you assume before lying down to take the bar. Before you lie
down, imagine a hand touching you right between the shoulder blades, as
illustrated in <a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_009.html#filepos605444"
class="calibre9">Figure 5-21</a>, and imagine pinching the hand between
your shoulder blades. This pinching will also cause you to raise your
chest as your upper back tightens, further contributing to a good
position. Now actively raise your chest, lifting it up as if to show
someone your boobs (Again, sorry for the coarse analogy, but you now
know exactly how to produce the contraction). This is the position you
will take against the bench. Now lie down, take the bar out, and assume
this position, making sure your shoulder blades are together and your
chest is up high. Do a few reps, correcting your position before and
after each one and focusing intently on the way it feels to do it
correctly. This way, the position becomes embedded quickly and you can
assume it without a lot of conscious thought or direction.

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>During the lift, minimal shoulder
movement should occur. If the shoulders move much, something in the
upper back has loosened and the chest has lost some of its “up”
position. The thing that moves is the elbow. Now, it should be obvious
that the humerus moves within the glenohumeral joint, so the shoulder
movement referred to here is the forward shrug that novices often add to
the end of the bench press before being coached. Some minimal scapular
movement is unavoidable, particularly in a set of more than a couple of
reps, but if it is excessive, it will compromise your efficiency by
adding to the distance the bar has to travel to lockout. This effect can
be illustrated by examining what happens during a shoulder shrug and the
distance it adds to the bar movement.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Lie on the bench and pull your shoulders
back into full adduction, with your chest up in a good position and your
back arched. Put your arms up with straight elbows in a position that
simulates the start of the bench press. Note the position of your hands.
Now shrug your shoulders up off the bench so that your shoulder blades
come out of adduction, and note the difference in position. There will
be a 4- to 6-inch difference in the distance from your hands to your
chest from shrugged-back to shrugged-up. This is the extra distance you
have to push the bar if you don’t keep your shoulders
back.</span></span></p>

<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>During a longer set (more than just a
couple of reps), most inexperienced people will let their upper back
deteriorate out of the shrugged position. If this happens, each rep is a
little looser than the previous one and the bar must travel a little
farther each time. At the end of a set of five, reset your shoulder
blades and chest-up position. If you are able to move them much at all,
they have come out of position. Your goal is to be able to do all your
reps without losing the set position. </span></span></p>

<p><span class="calibre5"><span
class="bold"><span>Neck</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The function of the neck muscles is to
maintain the head’s position and to protect the cervical spine during
the loading of the chest and upper back as the bar comes down on the
chest. The neck muscles therefore function isometrically to maintain
position, in a role similar to that of the lower back muscles during the
deadlift. But unlike the back muscles, the neck muscles should not
transfer power along the neck to help with the lift. In other words, you
do not use your neck to bench press. Do not push your head into the
bench, even if you have been told that it will create a stronger rebound
off the chest. It very well might, but this is an excellent way to
injure your neck. You need to learn how to tighten up your neck without
pushing on the bench with the back of your head. As a practical matter,
this involves holding your head about a quarter-inch off the bench
during the rep; think about touching the bench with your
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">hair</span></span></span><span> instead of with your
head. If your head is held off the bench, your neck muscles are tight.
It is tempting to use the neck to push the bench, as it adds contracted
muscle and tightness to the upper back area, but it is too dangerous a
habit to let become established in a novice lifter. If you become a
competitive lifter and decide that pushing your head forcefully into the
bench is enough help to your bench press to warrant the risk, fine. But
save that for later, when you’re in a better position to evaluate the
cost/benefit situation. </span></span></p>

the head into the bench under very heavy weights, and this position
prevents the improper use of the neck muscles in this
situation.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Likewise, do not get in the habit of
shifting your head so that your eyes can see one side of the bench
uprights when you’re racking the weight. Doing so requires that your
fatigued neck rotate under a load, and this is just plain old dumb. You
know where the rack is, and if your grip has been set correctly, your
elbows are locked, and your spotter has been instructed even a tiny bit,
the bar will get back into the rack just fine without your having to
look at one side of the uprights. </span></span></p>

<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Lower back, hips, and
legs</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The bench press is an upper-body
exercise, but since the lifter’s feet are on the floor, everything
between the feet and the upper body has the potential to be somewhat
involved in the exercise. The lower back and the hips and legs are thus
the connection between the ground and the upper back. Strictly speaking,
the kinetic chain begins at the bar and ends at the upper-back/bench
interface; the legs are not in the kinetic chain because the movement
can be performed with a large percentage of 1RM with the feet up in the
air. Since the movement itself is not dependent on the feet and legs,
they are not part of the kinetic chain (</span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">kinetic = movement, chain =
components</span></span></span><span>), in the same way that the arms
are not part of the kinetic chain of the squat. But the correctly
utilized back, hip, and leg positions actually represent an important
connection to the ground. In the same way the arms are a necessary
connection to the bar in the squat, even though they’re not an actual
part of the kinetic chain, the legs do more than stabilize the lower
body as the bar is moved through its path, although that is a major part
of their function. Used correctly, the legs drive against the floor,
transferring force horizontally along the bench through the hips into
the arched back to reinforce the arch and keep the chest in its high
position, established when the shoulders were pulled back. The legs and
hips thus function as a brace for the chest and shoulders, giving the
upper body a connection to the floor and allowing the lower body to
contribute to the movement. </span></span></p>

<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Before you have a chance to
misinterpret, this is not the same thing as bridging or heaving the bar.
That happens when the butt actually comes off the bench. Correct use of
the legs and hips involves only the maintenance of chest and back
position, with the force directed horizontally along the bench and not
vertically up off of the bench. The descent of the bar tends to drive
the elevated chest back down, taking arch out of the back if it is
inadequately supported. The legs drive from the feet against the floor,
back up along the bench, using a controlled isometric knee extension,
with a slight hip extension produced by isometric contraction of the
glutes and hamstrings. They actively counter the loss of arch in the
back and chest height by reinforcing the arch from the floor.

</span></span></span><span> Not the same thing as described in the
previous figure. This is bridging, and it is a bad habit to
acquire.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>But a common problem usually follows the
realization that the legs are useful in the bench press. Bridging – the
intentional heaving of the hips clear of contact with the bench in order
to meet the bar earlier – occurs as the lifter attempts to increase the
chest height by using his lower body to steepen the angle of his upper
back on the bench. Bridging takes work away from the target muscles by
making the range of motion shorter. (The popular gym exercise known as
the decline bench press takes advantage of this position of increased
mechanical efficiency. Most people can decline more than they bench,
thus the popularity.) Some purists believe that we are cheating when we
arch the back at all, but this program seeks to use all reasonable means
to increase strength on the bench press. Bridging is a good place to
draw the line. Lifting the butt off the bench has got to be learned as
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">verboten</span></span></span><span> in the same way that
use of the hands is in soccer. The temptation is always there, but if
the correct habits are learned early, it will not usually be a problem.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The back arch is easy to learn. Assume
your position on the bench, and imagine someone shoving a hand under
your low back as you keep your butt in contact with the bench. Then
imagine a clenched fist doing the same thing. Keep your lats in mind
when you assume this position. <a

class="calibre9">Figure 5-26</a> provides a reference. Remember that you
cannot raise your butt up off of the bench, so it’s much better to learn
to arch without cheating from the beginning. Make yourself do it
correctly, and resist the temptation to bridge your butt up.

<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Your feet are your connection to the
ground. If your foot slips during a heavy bench, the position supported
by the lower body – your back arch and your chest-up position,
everything you’re using to push the bar – collapses. The feet must be in
the correct position on the floor, and they must be positioned against
the floor correctly. </span></span></p>
<br />
<span class="calibre1"></span>
<p><span class="calibre7"><img src="./images/00354.jpg" class="calibre8"

<br />

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure 5-27.
</span></span></span><span> The main parameters for foot placement in
the bench are up/down (A) and in/out (B).</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Foot placement on the floor has two
variables: width and placement relative to the hips. The feet need to be
far enough apart to provide lateral stability for the hips and, through
the tightness in the trunk muscles, the torso as it is planted on the
bench. An excessively wide stance is seldom a problem, as it is
uncomfortable and hard to maintain. A narrow stance does not guarantee
disaster, and many competitive lifters prefer this position. In fact,
for a competitive lifter, any stance that facilitates a legal bench
press with optimum chest position is just fine. But a novice has enough
to worry about with just learning to move the bar correctly, and a
moderate-width stance presents fewer technical problems.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>More of a problem is placing the feet up
too far, back under the hips with the knees at an acute angle. This
position predisposes you to bridge your butt up in the air, and that is
usually the reason people do it – if you have your feet too far up under
your butt, and too close together with your heels up off the floor,
you’re going to bridge the heavy reps. A wider stance tends to moderate
this effect. If the feet are up too far in a closer stance, the knee
extension, being done from a more acute knee angle, tends to raise the
hips. A more moderate knee angle generates force more parallel to the
torso (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_009.html#filepos621878"
class="calibre9">Figure 5-28</a>). Having the feet too far down, with
the knees too straight, is commonly seen in novice lifters who have yet
to learn how to use the hips and legs. This position makes it difficult
to get enough “bite” against the floor to generate and maintain good
tension in the upstream components (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_009.html#filepos621878"
class="calibre9">Figure 5-28</a>). Your foot position should be set so
that your shins are nearly vertical, give or take a few degrees either
way, in both axes. This way, your knees are almost directly over your
feet at any width, without any adduction of the femurs. This position
allows for efficient use of your legs in reinforcing the arch, but
doesn’t create a predisposition to bridge. </span></span></p>

<br />

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure 5-28.
</span></span></span><span> Correct positioning on the bench is
important to learn. Place your ankles and knees first, and then position
your hips as you lie down under the bar. (A) In a good position, the
pelvis is flatter and the ankles and knees are positioned to drive
against the floor and back up the bench to the shoulders. (B) The bad
position in the center is the perfect setup for a bridge. The entire
foot should be in contact with the floor. (C) Likewise, too much knee
extension provides a poor brace against the floor.
</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>This is not to say that everybody with
their feet up under the hips will bridge. But most lifters who bridge do
so from this position. A little wider foot position, particularly with
the feet in full contact with the floor, will make it difficult to
bridge because the slack has been taken out of the
hips.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The proper position for the feet is flat
against the floor so that the heels can be used as the base of the drive
up the legs. As with most of the things in the weight room, your heels
need to be nailed down to the floor. If you are up on your toes, you
cannot use the force of knee extension nearly as efficiently as you can
if your heels are planted, unless your feet are back under the hips.
Flat feet are stickier feet, better connected to the ground through more
surface area. A less-than-flat position represents a less-than-complete
kinetic chain. Any rolling of the feet to either side during a rep
implies that the knees have moved, the chain has loosened, or the floor
connection has been interrupted. If you keep your heels down, driving
off of them with flat feet, the problem goes away. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>A bad problem when it occurs is an
actual foot slip. It usually happens when the weight is very heavy and
the floor connection is loaded heavily and therefore crucial. A foot
slip results in a disruption and collapse of the lower-body support for
the kinetic chain, and usually a missed rep or attempt, and any miss
with a heavy bar can be dangerous. A foot slip is usually caused by
conditions on the surface of the floor or the soles of the shoes, like
the presence of baby powder (as is used on the legs in the deadlift in
meets, or as an aid in putting on a tight squat suit) or just a dirty
floor. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>There are people – usually casual
trainers, fitness enthusiasts, or retired powerlifters – who insist on
benching with their feet up on the bench or even held up in the air (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_009.html#filepos626593"
class="calibre9">Figure 5-29</a>). The effect of either position is to
eliminate the use of the lower body during the movement and thus make
the bench press less efficient than it would be with the brace against
the floor. It is useful for a trainee with a lower-back injury that
makes spinal extension painful, distracting, or otherwise
contraindicated, but who still needs to bench. If you prefer to bench
with your feet up, it might be due to lower back discomfort caused by a
lack of lumbar flexibility; if the spinal ligaments are too tight to
permit the degree of spinal extension that the normal bench position
requires, stretching is in order. If your back is okay, you should be
able to keep your feet down on the floor. Blocks or barbell plates can
be used to add height to the floor for inflexible people until they
stretch out or to accommodate shorter-legged trainees. The net effect of
the use of the lower body is to increase the weight that can be lifted,
so putting your feet up lowers the amount of weight lifted, but the
exercise can still be done without it. The decision to do a feet-up
bench should be made by a lifter who is cognizant of the benefits of
training around injuries and the limitations inherent in doing it this
way. </span></span></p>

<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>As it is for all barbell exercises, air
is support for the bench press. In the squat and deadlift, the Valsalva
maneuver (as described in the Squat chapter) provides increased back
support. In the bench press, it provides support for the chest. This
support takes the form of increased tightness throughout the thoracic
cavity due to the increase in pressure provided by the big, held breath.
A tight rib cage allows for a more efficient transfer of power to the
bar by the muscles attached to the rib cage when they contract. If the
pec and delt origins on the external chest wall contract against a tight
structure that does not move when they contract, then more of the force
of that contraction can be transferred to the end of the kinetic chain
that does move. When the rib cage is tight, less force gets absorbed, or
dampened, by movement of the chest. This tightness, along with the
support provided by the lower body connected to the ground, radically
increases efficiency in the bench press. Also, in the extended spinal
position that the arch requires on the bench, the abs cannot tighten as
effectively. They cannot therefore as effectively increase
intra-abdominal pressure to contribute to the needed increase in
intra-thoracic pressure, thus making the big breath the primary source
of support for the chest.</span></span></p>

extended before the rep starts, allows for a more complete filling of
the lungs, a better chest angle, and better
stability.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The pattern of breathing during the
bench press depends on the length of the set and the abilities of the
lifter. Novices should take a breath before each rep, hold it during the
rep, and exhale at lockout, using the very brief break between reps to
make sure everything is positioned correctly. More experienced lifters
may prefer to use one breath for the whole set. Any exhalation involves
a certain amount of loosening of the chest to exhale and re-inhale, and
some lifters may decide to stay tight and do the whole set in one breath
if it is important and if they can hold their breath that long. Most
people can manage only five reps this way before the discomfort from the
hypoxia becomes too distracting. For a longer set, some quick breaths
will be required.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The breath has to be taken before the
rep. If the breath is taken during the rep, the lungs will incompletely
fill due to the loading of the rib cage by the now-contracted pecs. If
the breath is taken at the top with locked elbows, the pecs are not
pulling on the rib cage and a more complete inhalation can take place.
Moreover, when the bar actually starts down, everything should be tight,
from the floor to your fingernails, and this tightness will prevent you
from taking a really big breath. If you can breathe during a rep, you’re
not tight enough.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>No breath taken during the set will
involve the complete exchange of the full tidal volume of your lungs.
This takes too long, requires too much relaxation, and is unnecessary.
Breathing during the set consists only of topping off the huge breath
taken before the first rep, after a quick exhalation that might consist
of only 10% of tidal volume. This short refresher of air is just enough
to allow the set to be finished more comfortably. The fact that it
amounts to so little air is the reason you might decide to forego it in
favor of maintaining tightness, after you practice it.

<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Racking
Errors</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Taking the bar out of the rack and
putting it back may seem like rather innocuous parts of the exercise,
and most people give it no thought. Please be aware of the fact that any
time a loaded bar is located above your face and throat, you have a
potentially dangerous situation. The unracking and racking procedures
must be done correctly from the beginning, because most of the danger
involved in this most dangerous exercise in the weight room is
associated with getting the bar in and out of the rack. So, in the
interest of furthering safety in the weight room, here are The
Rules:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="bold">Do not use a
thumbless grip on the bench press.</span></span></span><span> If the bar
is not secure in your grip, it is not secure at all. A thumb around the
bar by no means guarantees that you will never drop the bar, but a
thumbless grip increases, by an order of magnitude, the likelihood that
you </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">will
</span></span></span><span>drop the bar.</span></li>
<li><span>Any time the bar is coming out of the rack or moving back into
the rack, it will be over your throat and face. Therefore,
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="bold">when the bar is
moving into or out of the rack, your elbows must be
locked.</span></span></span><span> This rule applies whether you are
being spotted or not. The triceps should lock the elbows over the rack
hooks so that the bones of the arm are in a straight line and the weight
is being supported by the skeletal components instead of by the muscles
when the bar moves over the head and neck. The first thing you do when
unracking the bar is to lock your elbows before you move the bar into
position. The last thing you do when racking the bar is to unlock your
elbows after the bar touches the uprights. </span></li>
<li><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="bold">Start and finish
every rep from the start position over your shoulder joints.
</span></span></span><span>It is common to see novices stop the bar as
it comes out of the rack short of the starting position, at a point over
the throat, lower the first rep to the chest at an angle, and come
straight up to the correct position to start the second rep. Some people
get in the habit of taking the bar down to the chest right out of the
rack. But the bar should never start down before it is in place – if it
does, there will be bar path problems due to the lack of an initial
ceiling reference for position and the fact that the bar is going back
to a different place than it started from. Both of these problems create
the potential for killing yourself, so don’t make either mistake. Only
after the bar gets all the way to the start position and your eyes have
found their place against the ceiling should the bar start
down.</span></li>
<li><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="bold">Never shove the bar
toward the rack before the rep is finished.</span></span></span><span>
Many people do this on the last rep of a set, in a hurry to rack the
bar. Always wait until the rep is locked out in the balanced start
position before you move the bar back to the rack. If you’re going to
miss a rep and your spotter fails, it is preferable to have the bar come
back down on your chest rather than on your face. If you don’t make it
to the rack with the bar, your bent elbows cannot support a heavy load
over your face. This sloppy habit indicates a lack of patience, an
unwillingness to take a few extra seconds to do things correctly and
safely, and a lack of respect for heavy weights that can hurt you very
badly in this position.</span></li>
<li><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="bold">If you are benching
heavy by yourself, always bench inside a power rack.
</span></span></span><span>You can set the pins at a level just barely
below your chest so that if you miss a rep, you can lower the bar to the
pins and escape safely. </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="bold">If you do not have a power rack, do not bench heavy by
yourself. </span></span></span><span>This is what kills more people with
barbells every year than any other stupid thing people do with barbells.
If you get trapped under a heavy bar, it can kill you. Really. It
happens.</span></li>
<li><span>If you insist on not following rule #5, </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="bold">at least have enough sense to NOT
COLLAR THE BAR. </span></span></span><span>If you secure the plates with
collars, “for safety” like the poster in the weight room explains, and
you get stuck under the bar by yourself, you cannot tilt the bar, slide
the plates off, and get out from underneath it. Even the cost of
wrecking the room by dumping the load on one side of the bar will be
cheaper than your ass, which you’ll admit is a higher price to
pay.</span></li>
<li><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="bold">If your spotter has
to take the bar, don’t release your grip; help the spotter get the bar
back in the rack. </span></span></span><span>Leaving the spotter with a
heavy bar unsupported from below will get you both hurt – his back and
your face. If your spotter is attentive enough to do his job correctly,
be good enough to help get the bar back in the rack. Unless the spotter
is very strong or the weight is very light, a loaded barbell any
distance at all from his center of mass cannot be handled with arm
strength. If you bail out of the rep and leave the spotter with what is

</span></span></span><span> On the final rep, it is common to push the
bar back toward the rack before finishing the rep, instead of driving
into a proper lockout over the chest. If you miss the last rep (and if
you miss a rep, it will probably be the last one), where would you
rather the bar come back down – on your chest or on your face? Get in
the habit of finishing every rep correctly.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span class="calibre5"><span
class="bold"><span>Spotters</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>In many gyms around the world, bench
pressing is a team activity. The guy on the bench is “doing chest” while
the guy standing over his head is working on his traps. It is truly
amazing how much weight two guys working together like this can “bench
press.” It is not an exaggeration to say that the vast majority of big
gym bench presses are exaggerations. If the spotter puts his hands on
the bar during the first rep, and keeps them there for the rest of the
set, then who has lifted what, and why?</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>There is a perfectly legitimate place in
the weight room for spotters, but it is not in the middle of someone
else’s work set. Spotters should not be there to help with a set. The
role of the spotter is to help get the bar out of the rack and into the
start position over the shoulders by helping to overcome the long moment
arm between the rack and the shoulder joints. The problem with many
spotters is that they create more problems than they solve. The bench
press is actually a simple movement to learn correctly, and more people
have problems with their spotters than they do with the exercise itself.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Spotters should be there for safety,
when a question of safety exists. For everybody except rank novices, the
first warm-up sets are not a safety concern and do not require spotters
unless the spotter is also performing a coaching function. As the weight
gets heavier, a spot becomes more necessary: some people need one on the
last warm-up sets, and everybody should be spotted on the work sets
because the weight is supposed to be heavy. Excessive caution and the
insistence that every set be spotted for everybody is inefficient,
unnecessary, and bothersome to other people in the gym who are trying to
train. But if your gym contains mostly people who can’t be bothered to
help you when it is legitimately necessary, it could be a problem. Get a
spot when you need to, and know when this is.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>For the bench press, a competent center
spot will suffice for all but the very heaviest attempts – the kind
reserved for a meet, unless you’re training at a national-level
powerlifting gym. A good handoff is one of those rare commodities –
there are more bad ones than good. A bad handoff interferes with the
lifter’s timing, balance, view of the ceiling, and concentration by the
spotter’s attempting to participate in the rep. A good handoff spotter
is experienced and appropriate with the timing and amount of bar
contact, respectful of the mental requirements of the lifter, and, above
all, conservative about when and how much to help.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The bench press spotter stands behind
the head of the lifter, in the center of the bar (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_009.html#filepos642510"
class="calibre9">Figure 5-32</a>). This position can be adjusted a
little if necessary. The primary requirement of the position is that it
is close enough for the spotter to grab the bar, but far enough back
that after the handoff, the lifter has an unobstructed view of the
ceiling. From this position, the spotter can do whatever might be
necessary at the end of the set, from just watching the lifter finish
the set, to securing the rack by following the bar as it meets the
uprights, to taking the bar out of a sticking point. </span></span></p>
<br />
<span id="filepos642510"

<br />

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure 5-32.
</span></span></span><span> The standard spotting position (A) allows
for a quick and safe response to problems. But the proper role of the
spotter must be understood. The spotter provides a measure of safety and
confidence and can help through a sticking point on the last rep and
ensure that the bar is racked safely (B)</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>If you actually get stuck during a rep,
your spotter needs to be the one to decide that this has occurred, that
he will take the bar, and how much of the weight to take when he does.
The bar is stuck when it reaches a point of zero upward movement. This
will shortly be followed by a deterioration in position as the bar
begins to move down. Sometimes you’ll be able to tell the spotter to
take the bar, and sometimes you won’t. Your spotter has to accurately
evaluate the bar velocity, being certain not to take a bar that is still
moving up, yet not failing to take it before it sticks for too long or
goes back down too much or too fast.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>After the spotter decides to take the
bar, the amount of help provided will depend on the situation and a
correct assessment of it. When someone is spotting an intermediate
lifter with the last rep of the fifth set of five, the situation will
warrant a different amount of help than in the case of an experienced
lifter being spotted on a PR single, or a novice trainee doing the first
heavy work set of his third workout. Each instance requires a different
response in terms of how quickly to react, how closely to follow the
bar, how much weight to take off, whether to help maintain bar velocity,
and how fast and how hard to help rack the bar.</span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>So, in the interest of fostering a
constructive relationship between you and your spotter, here are The
Rules for Spotters: </span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<ol>
<li><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="bold">At work-set
weights, the spotter always watches every rep</span></span></span><span>
and is ready to react to the lifter’s situation. Complete riveted
attention is not necessary for warm-up sets for which the spotter is not
coaching a novice, but for heavy sets, when the weight has the potential
to cause problems, the spotter must be watching the bar. A spotter who
is looking around the room during a heavy set is </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">not
spotting</span></span></span><span>.</span></li>
<li><span>This one is tough for many people because it seems to conflict
with #1, so try to perceive the nuance: after the spotter hands the bar
off to the lifter, </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="bold">the spotter must </span></span></span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="bold"><span class="italic">stay out of
the way</span></span></span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="bold"> until either the last rep is completed or the lifter
</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">needs
help</span></span></span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="bold">.</span></span></span><span> The lifter is looking at the
ceiling, so “out of the way” means out of the lifter’s sight picture of
the ceiling and the bar. If you are the spotter, do not hover over the
lifter and do not stick your hands anywhere near the bar, because doing
so will distract the lifter, who is staring at the position reference on
the ceiling. “Needs help” means that the lifter cannot complete the rep,
indicated by the fact that the bar a) has actually stopped moving up for
more than 1 or 2 seconds, b) has started to move back down, or c) has
moved in a direction other than up, i.e., toward the face, toward the
feet, or sideways. </span></li>
<li><span> If you are the spotter and you determine that the lifter
needs help, take the bar with your hands and guide it back to the rack
hooks. (The lifter should stay with you during this process, not
releasing his grip on the bar.) But unless the lifter actually needs
help – see rule #2 – </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="bold">Do Not Touch The Bar.</span></span></span><span> This rule
must be strictly obeyed because </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">any rep touched by anyone other
than the lifter cannot be counted as a rep by the
lifter</span></span></span><span>. This means that a set of 5 reps, the
last one of which was “spotted,” i.e., touched IN ANY WAY by the
spotter, is officially a set of 4 reps. If you are the lifter, this rule
keeps your rep count honest; without it, you have no way of knowing how
much help you were given and therefore no way of honestly claiming to
have done the rep unassisted.<br />
      If the numbers written down in your training log are not honest,
you have absolutely no way to evaluate the results of your program.
Since there is no point in lying to yourself about your workout,
counting an assisted rep as yours is pointless in the long term. This
principle obviously applies to all lifts that customarily require
spotters. If you let your spotter help you on your work sets, you’ll
soon have absolutely no idea what you’re really benching, and no idea if
you’re making progress.</span></li>
<li><span>This is worth repeating: </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="bold">any rep touched by anybody other
than the lifter does NOT BELONG TO THE LIFTER.
</span></span></span><span>As a spotter, you are responsible for
controlling your desire to participate in the set. Your job is to help
if necessary, not to share the work and the glory. Stay away from the
bar unless your help is actually needed; if you don’t, the lifter has my
permission to slap you for interfering with his potential personal
record.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>For both lifter and spotter, when
racking the bar, make sure that you touch the uprights
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">first</span></span></span><span>. Don’t try to set the
bar down directly on the hooks. If you (the lifter) move the bar back
with locked elbows until it touches the vertical part of the uprights,
and then slide it down onto the hooks, you won’t have to worry about
whether it will stay in the rack. If the uprights are touched first, the
bar will always be above the hooks. If straightening out your elbows got
the bar clear of the hooks when you took it out, then locked elbows will
ensure that it is high enough to get back over the hooks when you’re
racking it. (If your arms are short, you need to use a bench with
adjustable uprights.) But if you try to set the bar down on the
horizontal surface first, then you are not all the way back to the
uprights as you try to set the bar down, and you will eventually miss
the rack, usually one of the hooks on one side. This same advice applies
to the squat for exactly the same reasons. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Certain circumstances might require the
use of two spotters, as during the heavy attempts at a power meet, but
normal weight-room conditions very seldom require more than one
competent spotter. The problem with two spotters is the unalterable fact
that two people cannot assist one lifter in a perfectly balanced way,
especially when they must react quickly. The uneven loading that the
lifter will inevitably experience is a potential source of injury. It is
physically impossible for two people, even careful, experienced people,
to pull upward with exactly the same amount of force on each side of a
bar. They will therefore subject the lifter to uneven loading at exactly
the time when that stress is most likely to cause an injury – during a
rep that is too heavy to lift. This is true of both the squat and the
bench press. The problem in the bench press is solved with the use of
the single spotter, a perfectly reasonable way to spot for the vast
majority of bench press workouts in which the weight on the bar has been
correctly selected. </span></span></p>

Clean </span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<hr />
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The power clean cannot be done slowly.
There is therefore no confusion over the nature of the exercise. In
essence, it is a jump with the bar in the hands, after which the bar is
caught on the shoulders. The power clean is used in sports conditioning
because it trains explosion, and done correctly it is the best exercise
for converting the strength obtained in the other exercises to power.
Other, easier-to-learn exercises like the vertical jump require
explosion, and plyometrics have recently come into fashion in strength
and conditioning for this reason. But the clean and the snatch are
unique in their ability to be incrementally loaded with an increasingly
heavier weight, making it possible to develop a more powerful explosion
in a simple programmed way. Since the nature of the vast majority of
sports is explosive, involving the athlete’s ability to accelerate his
body or an object, the ability to accelerate is pivotal in sports
performance. The power clean is our most important tool in this war
against inertia.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>In his famous book </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">The Strongest Shall
Survive</span></span></span><span>, Bill Starr included the power clean
in his “Big Three,” with the comment that “If your program only allowed
you to do one exercise, this would be the best.” The power clean has
always been used by weightlifters as an assistance exercise for the
clean, the more complicated version of the lift. The term “clean” refers
to a way to get the bar clear of the floor and up to the shoulders,
without soiling the bar by touching the body on the way up, as required
by the rules in place several decades ago. If this is accomplished in
one movement, it is a clean; if it is done in two movements (if the bar
stops on a belt or the chest on the way up), it is referred to as a
“Continental,” due apparently to the absence of a rule against it in
mainland European contests at the time. In modern usage, the term
“clean” refers to a full squat clean. It has not always been this way.
The </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">split
clean</span></span></span><span> – a style that used a forward/back
split like that commonly used for the jerk in Olympic weightlifting –
was the standard version until the 1960s, when the squat style began to
be favored due to the heavier weights that could be lifted with this
front-squat-based technique. </span></span></p>
<br />
<span class="calibre1"></span>
<p><span class="calibre7"><img src="./images/00363.jpg" class="calibre8"

<br />

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure 6-1.</span></span></span><span>
The power clean is a variation of the squat clean – usually referred to
as the “clean” – used in Olympic weightlifting. Bill Starr cleans 435 at
the 1969 Nationals. </span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The term “power” as a qualifier in front
of an exercise refers to an abbreviated version of a more complicated
movement, the shorter version being harder to perform because the extra
technique stuff is there to make it easier to lift more weight. A
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">power
snatch</span></span></span><span> is a snatch without a squat or split,
the use of which reduces the distance the bar must be pulled. The
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">power
jerk</span></span></span><span> is a version of the last part of the
clean and jerk, but in the power jerk, the feet do not split. Likewise,
the </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">power
clean</span></span></span><span> is the version of the clean without a
split and without a front squat. The power clean therefore requires more
“pull” in that the bar must travel higher as a result of the explosion,
without moving the body to drop under the bar. As we’ll see, the term is
actually used correctly here as it pertains to the science of movement.
</span></span></p>
<br />
<span class="calibre1"></span>
<p><span class="calibre7"><img src="./images/00364.jpg" class="calibre8"
alt="split_clean.tif" /></span></p>
<br />

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure 6-2.</span></span></span><span>
The split clean was commonly used prior to the 1960s and is a useful
competitive style for some lifters who lack sufficient flexibility to
make the squat style advantageous. Rudolf Pflugfelder, Olympic and World
Champion, using this style.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Any clean requires the lifter to pull
the barbell up fast enough and high enough, by using power generated by
the hips and legs, to catch it on the shoulders. After the feet break
contact with the floor, force cannot be applied to the bar. This is
because the force is generated by the components of the body that are
operating between the load in the hands and the ground. When the feet
break contact with the floor, the bar is moving up as fast as it is
going to. It continues to travel upward due to the inertia it acquires
during the active part of the pull. The faster the bar comes up, the
higher it will go, because the faster it is moving, the more inertia it
possesses. The heavier the weight, the harder this is to do. So the
better a lifter is at accelerating the bar, the more inertia he can
impart to the bar and the more weight he can clean.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>As a corollary, a lifter can clean more
weight if he can get better at getting under a bar not pulled as high.
This is the purpose served by splitting and squatting: they both shorten
the distance the bar has to be pulled by allowing the lifter to jump
under the bar in a lower position. Since our purpose is sports
conditioning – not cleaning heavy weights per se, but rather generating
as much upward explosion as possible – we will use the power version of
the lift.</span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>A few authorities have taken the
position that the squat clean is the superior version of the lift for
most training purposes, arguing that going under the bar – when the
front squat is taught as a part of the lift – translates into more foot
movement and thus more athletic carryover. On this basis, a better case
can be made for using the split clean. And a case can be made for the
fact that the squat clean is easier on the knees because the hamstrings
and adductors can help absorb the shock of the catch. A novice’s knees
are not yet this tender. But be aware that the front squat will
interfere with your back squat form if you are learning both movements
at the same time. The novice using this method will devote considerable
time and energy to the task of unlearning a quadriceps-dominant squat,
the result of poor prior instruction or no instruction at all.
Incorporating a front squat into the clean will complicate the process
without making the clean any more explosive – our primary objective in
doing it, anyway.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The front squat and the back squat are
radically different exercises, and while competitive Olympic
weightlifters must learn and train the front squat, the back squat is
far more important to general strength and conditioning. Even when used
as a part of the clean, the front squat is best left to
intermediate-level lifters to learn after good back squat technique has
been nailed down by several months of training. This, in addition to the
fact that a power clean is pulled to a higher position, is the reason
that power cleans are the recommended explosive lift for novices.
</span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The term </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">power</span></span></span><span>
has a very specific meaning in the study of mechanics.
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">Work</span></span></span><span> is the amount of force
applied to an object that makes it move a resulting distance, and this
quantity expended per unit of time is </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">power</span></span></span><span>.
Written as an equation, it is </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">(FD)/T = P</span></span></span><span>, where P is power,
F is the force, D is the distance over which the force acts, and T is
the time it takes to perform this work. When we’re referring to the
total amount of work done over a longer period of time – the duration of
a set of five reps, for example – the proper term is </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">average
power</span></span></span><span>. When the timeframe in question becomes
very short, like the duration of a clean or snatch, the term used is
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">instantaneous
power</span></span></span><span>. Physicists measure it in joules per
second, or </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">watts</span></span></span><span>. In our discussion of
the power clean and its application to explosive training and athletics,
instantaneous power is what we are concerned with. It can be best
understood as the ability to exert force rapidly – to display strength
quickly.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>More terms now: </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">Speed</span></span></span><span>
is the rate of change in the position of an object. If the direction of
the speed is specified, we refer to the </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">velocity</span></span></span><span> of the object – the
bar moving </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">up</span></span></span><span> at 2 meters per second.
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">Acceleration</span></span></span><span> is the rate of
change of velocity over time – the increase in velocity (or decrease,
known as </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">deceleration</span></span></span><span>), or how fast the
velocity is changing. </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">Force</span></span></span><span> is the influence that
causes acceleration; for an object to accelerate, force must be applied
to it. </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">Strength</span></span></span><span> is the physical
ability to generate force against an external resistance. (It is
difficult to define strength when it is applied isometrically, i.e.,
when the application of force causes no movement of an object outside
the body, but rather stays within the physical system of the muscles and
skeleton. Isometric force production is an important part of barbell
training, but for purposes of defining strength, movement of the bar is
our primary quantifying measurement.) </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Power in the weight room is therefore
the ability to generate force rapidly. A more familiar term for this
might be “quickness,” especially when applied to the movement of the
body itself. For many sports, just being strong is not enough; you must
also possess the ability to rapidly employ your strength so that you can
accelerate better – both your own bodyweight and that of a physical
opponent or a thrown implement. A strong man might very well be able to
apply enough force to a very heavy weight to get it moving, but a
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">powerful</span></span></span><span> man can get it moving
more quickly. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The vertical jump is a valuable
diagnostic test for power. It directly measures an athlete’s ability to
generate force rapidly enough to accelerate his bodyweight off the
ground, and it is a valuable assessment of genetic capacity. It is used
by the NFL as part of their Combine test to predict this aspect of
performance. Studies have shown that vertical jump performance is
predictive of sports proficiency, that power clean performance is
predictive of vertical jump performance, and that power clean
performance is predictive of squat strength. Squat performance is
predictive of squat jump performance, and squat jump performance is
predictive of power clean performance. The power clean, by training the
athlete’s ability to move a heavy weight quickly, is the glue that
cements the strength training program to sports performance.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>One way to understand the concept of
power in this specific situation is to compare performances in the power
clean and the deadlift. As we have already seen, the deadlift is a
straight pull off the floor, with the lifter standing up with the bar
and the bar stopping at arms’ length, whereas the power clean continues
the pull on up through an explosive phase to a catch on the shoulders. A
power clean has a bar path that is twice as long as the deadlift’s, and
it uses 50–75% of the load of a heavy deadlift. Since work is calculated
by multiplying the amount of force used to overcome the weight of the
bar by the vertical distance the bar travels,</span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic"> </span></span></span><span>and
since the bar is pulled perhaps six times faster in a power clean
because it is half the weight of a deadlift, power outputs in a heavy
clean might be five to seven times as high as in a deadlift. A deadlift
can obviously be done with a heavier weight because it is a shorter
movement with no inherent requirement to accelerate the bar – if you can
just keep it moving up, however slowly, you can lock it out. Remember:
there can be no slow power cleans because they will not rack on the
shoulders, but a heavy deadlift might take 5–7 seconds to pull and it
will still be a deadlift. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Here is one of the most important facts
about training for strength, or power, or sports, or anything else:
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="bold">it is always
true that a man with a 500-pound deadlift will clean more than a man
with a 200-pound deadlift.</span></span></span><span> At its very core,
power is dependent upon strength: force production capacity that does
not exist cannot be displayed, quickly or otherwise. However, between
two men who both deadlift 500 pounds, the one moving it faster is
producing more acceleration – more force over a shorter timeframe – and
thus more power. This capacity is the ultimate difference between a
strong man and a strong </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">athlete</span></span></span><span>. The power clean is an
incrementally increasable way to develop this power.</span></span></p>
<br />
<span class="calibre1"></span>

<br />

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure 6-3.</span></span></span><span>
The power clean contributes to the deadlift, and the deadlift
contributes to the power clean. The power clean teaches timing and
athletic synchronization of complex multi-joint movements; it trains the
commitment involved in getting under the bar, the all-or-none that is
sometimes lacking in a deadlift attempt; it trains the rate of motor
unit recruitment, thus improving neuromuscular efficiency; and it
teaches explosion – the mental cue for highly efficient motor unit
recruitment. The deadlift develops the concentric and isometric strength
involved in holding the correct position through the slower parts of a
heavy clean, and the ability to hold the back rigid during the explosive
hip extension that makes for an efficient second pull; it increases the
total number of motor units that can be recruited in a contraction; it
teaches and enables “grind” – the patience necessary to maintain
position through a long effort; it disinhibits the nervous system
against heavier weights, so that heavy cleans feel light in contrast to
heavy deadlifts; and it develops the good old-fashioned ability to
produce force.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>A very strong powerlifter can deadlift
two to three times the weight he can power clean – because he probably
doesn’t train the clean at all. In the early days of powerlifting, most
competitors had weightlifting experience or were coached by people who
did. This being no longer the case, a powerlifter’s power clean might be
40% of his deadlift. In contrast, an Olympic weightlifter might clean
85% of his deadlift. This difference is a direct result of genetics and
training specificity. At the elite levels, all sports favor a certain
type of genetic predisposition. The elite powerlifter is an athlete who
is good at pulling heavy weights, and the elite weightlifter is good at
pulling moderate weights fast. And weightlifters tend to train with
lighter weights explosively, while powerlifters concentrate their
efforts on the slower movements that allow the use of heavier weights.
It is quite likely that a weightlifter who can deadlift only 450 pounds
over a 385-pound clean has not trained with sufficiently heavy weights
to develop his absolute strength. His clean would go up if he developed
his absolute strength off the floor. There is no reason that a lifter
with a 385 clean and a 450 deadlift can’t get his deadlift stronger,
unless he is happy with staying at a 385 clean. Or it could be that the
powerlifter with a 600-pound deadlift and a 240-pound clean has
neglected to develop his power off the floor. (“Powerlifting” is a bad
choice of name for the sport; it should be “strengthlifting,” but I
predict that my suggestion will not be adopted anytime soon.) Both
sports could benefit from more exposure to each other’s training
methods. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>These examples illustrate a way to
consider the relationship of absolute strength to power: you can think
of the power clean as being done with a percentage of the deadlift. In
other words, </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">explosive strength is displayed as a percentage of
absolute strength</span></span></span><span>. The ratio between the two
depends on training and genetics, and the vertical jump might be the
indicator of the ratio. Training can improve the ratio to a certain
extent, but genetics will limit this extent. What is certain is that as
the ability to produce force increases, the potential to display that
force as power goes up with it. The extent to which this is true at the
extreme limits of performance is unclear, but for novice lifters, there
is no question that the best way to make the clean stronger is to make
the deadlift stronger.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>If this is true, why train the power
clean at all? For some people, this is a legitimate question. Older
people with old-people’s elbows, shoulders, and wrists may elect not to
perform the exercise at all, as may very young trainees, people with
poor athletic ability, older women, or people with osteoporosis, chronic
knee tendinitis, or other problems that make the power clean more
trouble than it is productive. But for most other people and all
athletes, the power clean is the best way to increase the ability to
explode – to display power – where this ability needs to be developed.

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>To understand the nature of power
production by the human body, you need to understand the way the nervous
system controls the muscles. A detailed discussion of the physiology of
muscle contraction is outside the scope of this discussion, and can be
found in </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">Practical Programming for Strength Training, Second
Edition</span></span></span><span> (Aasgaard, 2009) and in many other
sources. Very short version: The muscles are composed of
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">muscle
fibers;</span></span></span><span> these are controlled by the
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">motor
neurons;</span></span></span><span> and the whole system of muscles plus
the controlling nervous system is collectively referred to as the
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">neuromuscular
system</span></span></span><span>. Each motor neuron controls many
muscle fibers, and the term </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">motor unit</span></span></span><span> refers to one motor
neuron and all the muscle fibers it innervates (supplies with nerve
fibers). The contraction, or </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">firing,</span></span></span><span> of motor units by the
neuromuscular system is called </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">recruitment.</span></span></span><span> It is considered
to be an all-or-none phenomenon: the muscle fibers of the motor unit,
when fired by a nervous impulse, come into contraction at 100% of their
capacity to do so. This means that a submaximal muscle contraction is
the result of a submaximal </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">percentage</span></span></span><span> of motor units
being recruited. The greater the force production requirements of the
task, the more motor units are recruited into contraction.

<br />

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure 6-4.</span></span></span><span>
Motor unit recruitment is the total activity of varying numbers of motor
units, all of which operate to the limits of their capacity when
individually called into contraction. The recruited motor units are in
full contraction, while the unrecruited motor units are not.
</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The ability to recruit motor units with
great efficiency – i.e., recruit high numbers of them quickly when a
task demands instantaneous high levels of force production – is largely
controlled by the genetic endowment of the individual. This ability
depends on the density of motor neuron populations within the muscles,
the quality of the nerve tissue, the quality of the nervous system
interface with the muscle fibers, the type of muscle fibers and their
ratio within the muscles, and other factors. Some of these factors can
adapt to the stress imposed by training, and some cannot. The
vertical-jump test is a naked look at the quality of the neuromuscular
system and is an indicator of the ultimate ability of an athlete to be
explosive. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Exercises that require the body to
explode into a high level of motor unit recruitment with heavy loads can
develop the aspects of the neuromuscular system that are capable of
adapting to the stress of the exercise. Athletes with a high vertical
jump have the </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">potential</span></span></span><span> to be more explosive
than athletes with a lower vertical jump. Likewise, athletes with lower
verticals who work harder to develop their neuromuscular efficiency,
compared to gifted athletes who sit on their asses, have the potential
to be better athletes than their gifted counterparts. The power clean
and other explosive exercises can develop this ability in an
incrementally increasable fashion: more weight can be loaded on the bar
each workout, and the increase can be precisely adjusted to match the
lifter’s ability to adapt, thus forcing the adaptation to occur. This
process allows for the controlled and programmed development of
explosive capacity and power.</span></span></p>

This would equate to 50–80% of 1RM, depending on the exercise.
“Strength” movements are those that are limited by strength, such as the
squat, press, deadlift, or similar exercises. “Power” movements are
those limited by power output, such as the snatch, jerk, clean, or other
similar exercises. From </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span

<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Power is low on the left side of the
graph, at very light weights, because light weights don’t require much
force to make them move fast. They move fast easily because the weight
is light. Power is also low on the right side of the graph, where the
weights get very heavy, because a very heavy weight is hard to move
fast. Remember: power requires velocity. Power peaks in the range of
50–75% of 1RM, where a moderately heavy weight can still be moved
relatively fast. The range represents differences in the nature of the
various exercises, whether the exercise is primarily an upper-body or
lower-body movement, and the skill, strength, experience, and sex of the
individual athlete. (Women can typically use a higher percentage of 1RM
explosively than men can.) This range (50–75% of 1RM) is also where the
power clean usually falls as a percentage of the deadlift.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The popular Westside Dynamic Effort
method, developed by Louie Simmons, trains power production by using
weights in the range of 50–75% of max in the squat, bench press, and
deadlift with an emphasis on maximum acceleration during the reps. Louie
has essentially figured out a way to train the squat, bench, and
deadlift as if they were Olympic lifts, by training them with weights
that can be used at the velocity that produces maximum power.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>A logical question, the converse of our
earlier one, might be: why do we need to squat and deadlift to develop
strength at slow speeds if we are training for power? Both types of
training are necessary and each type contributes to the development of
the other. Again, </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="bold">a man with a 500-pound deadlift can clean more than a man
with a 200-pound deadlift</span></span></span><span> because of the
great difference in the ability to produce force. But between two men
who both deadlift 500 pounds, the one moving it faster is producing more
force, is therefore stronger, and is training in a way that teaches his
muscles and nervous system to produce even more force. Training faster
with a given weight requires more force production because acceleration
requires force. And when the ability to produce force goes up, heavier
weights can be lifted. This is why the power clean makes the deadlift go
up and why the deadlift contributes to the power clean.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The weight that can be used for a heavy
power clean, for most athletes, is the correct weight to use to improve
force production. The weight is heavy enough to make the lifter pull
hard, and by its very nature, the power clean cannot be done without
explosion. Unless the bar is moving fast at the top, it will not even
rack on the shoulders. The power clean’s only drawback is that it is a
technique-dependent exercise. Let’s learn how to do it.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Learning the Power
Clean</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The power clean is best learned from the
top of the pull, down. This means that you will first learn the
technique of catching, or “racking,” the bar on the shoulders, so the
emphasis in your mind is on the rack position from the beginning. When
you are learning the power clean, remember that speed becomes important
at the top of the pull, not off the floor. The lower part of the pull,
from the floor to the mid-thigh, gets the bar in the correct position
for the explosive movement that racks the bar, and this lower part must
be done correctly, not quickly, at least at first. From the middle of
the pull on up, the movement must get faster, but this cannot be done
correctly if the lift has not been started from the floor correctly. By
learning the top of the power clean first, and worrying about getting it
down to the floor later, you assign the correct priority to the most
important part of the pull. After all, the first part of the power clean
is essentially a deadlift, which you already know how to do. When you
have learned the top of the pull, we will slide down, a little at a
time, into a deadlift, making the transition from half a power clean to
the whole thing. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The empty 20 kg (45 lb) bar will be
correct for most people to comfortably learn the movement with, but some
smaller kids and women might need a lighter bar, such as a 15 kg women’s
competition bar or an even lighter shop-built one. There is no point in
adding weight to the bar at first, because you are learning the movement
only. It doesn’t make sense to learn this movement without a bar, as you
do with the squat, because to do a clean, you need a bar to provide some
resistance for the elbows to rotate around. A broomstick or a piece of
PVC pipe is too light to have sufficient inertia to stay in place during
the turn, and learning with PVC is an excellent way to introduce bad arm
habits from the very beginning. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Foot position will be the same as for
the deadlift, and similar to the stance for a flat-footed vertical jump
or a standing broad jump: place your feet 8–12 inches apart, with your
toes pointed slightly out.<br />
<span class="calibre1"></span> </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><img src="./images/00368.jpg" class="calibre8"

<br />

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure 6-6.</span></span></span><span>
The basic stance for the clean is the same position used for a
flat-footed vertical jump.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />
This is the stance that allows you to apply maximum power to the ground
and begins the process of convincing you that the power clean is really
a jump. You will have to reset your stance before each rep, because
after the jump, your feet will land in what is essentially a squat
stance.<br />

<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Now that you have the correct stance and
an empty bar of the right weight, you will learn the hang position, the
rack position, and the jumping position, in that order.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Learning the hang,
rack, and jumping positions </span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>First, the position at the top of the
pull, with the bar in the hands at arms’ length and with straight
elbows, straight knees, and chest up, is referred to as the
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="bold">hang
position</span></span></span><span> (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_010.html#filepos689501"
class="calibre9">Figure 6-8</a>). Get into the hang position by taking
the EMPTY bar off the floor with a correct grip and deadlifting it. The
correct grip for most people will be about 2–3 inches wider on each side
than the grip they use for the deadlift. The power-clean grip is wide
enough to let the lifter’s elbows freely rotate up into the rack
position, to be described shortly, and will obviously vary with shoulder
width. Later, we will learn the hook grip, but for now, a normal
thumbs-around, or </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">double-overhand</span></span></span><span>, grip will be
fine. Your eyes will be looking at a spot on the floor about 12–15 feet
in front of you, just as in the deadlift. </span></span></p>
<br />
<span id="filepos689501"

The hang position. Note the straight elbows, internally rotated, and
that the lifter’s chest is up, eyes are looking slightly down, and feet
are in the pulling stance. </span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>In the hang position, your arms will be
internally rotated, placed in that position with the same motion used to
pronate the grip. This movement is used in the hang position to start
the process of learning to keep the elbows straight, one of the most
important, and apparently one of the hardest, things to learn about the
clean. Get in the habit early of snapping the elbows into this position
every time to begin the process of the clean. </span></span></p>
<br />
<span class="calibre1"></span>

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span

In the hang position, your reminder for straight elbows will be rotating
them internally. Make sure they stay in this position anytime the bar
hangs in the hands. </span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The next step is to get the bar onto the
shoulders. From the hang position, with the correct-width grip, get the
bar up onto your shoulders, any way you want to right now. It should sit
right on top of the frontal deltoids (the meaty part of the front of the
shoulders), well away from the sternum and collarbones. This position is
referred to as the </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="bold">rack position</span></span></span><span> (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_010.html#filepos691896"

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure
6-10.</span></span></span><span> The rack position, with chest up and
elbows pointed forward. </span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />
The key to this position is the elbows: they must be up very high,
pointed straight forward, with the humerus as nearly parallel to the
floor as possible. Some people will have trouble getting into this
position due to flexibility problems. A grip width adjustment usually
fixes this, especially if the forearms are longer than the upper arms.
Widen the grip a little at a time until the position is better. If your
elbows are up high enough, the bar will clear the bony parts and sit
comfortably on the bellies of the deltoid muscles. The bar should not be
sitting in the hands, and the hands are not supporting any of the
weight. The weight is resting on your shoulders, and your hands are
trapping it in position between your arms and shoulders, just like they
do in the squat. This position is secure and pain-free to the extent
that you will never in your entire life clean a weight that will be too
heavy to hold like this. It is imperative that you understand that this
is where the bar goes and not anywhere else – not sitting on your chest,
and not just carried in your hands. You must not stop with your elbows
pointing at the floor (<a

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure
6-12.</span></span></span><span> The cure for incorrect elbow position.
To fix the problem of lifting your elbows after an incorrect rack, you
can lift them (or have them lifted) repeatedly enough that initially
catching the bar in the correct position becomes
reflexive.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Lower the bar by dropping it down the
chest and catching it at the hang position. This means that you do not
reverse-upright-row or reverse-curl the bar down to the hang position –
you actually </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">drop the bar and catch it</span></span></span><span>.
Some people actually let it slip from their grip before they figure this
out. Just catch the bar at the hang, with no attempt at all to lower it
with the arms. This step teaches two important things. First, the bar
path in a clean must be as close to vertical as possible for physical
efficiency, and when you drop the bar down from the rack position close
to your chest, you are practicing the vertical bar path on the way down
that you will use on the way up. If you un-curl the bar to put it down,
you are pushing it away from the vertical balance line; dropping the bar
close to the chest keeps it directly above the mid-foot. Second, the
arms do not interact with the weight during a clean – what makes the bar
go up is the jump, not your arms performing an upright row (perhaps the
most unfortunate exercise ever invented, for several reasons). If you
learn immediately that the arms do not either raise OR lower the bar,
you will help solve the arm-pull problem before it has a chance to
develop. And when you practice this way, you double the amount of bar
path practice you can get when you clean. So we’ll start the process
from the first rep. Just drop it and catch it.</span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Get back in the hang position, and then
unlock your knees and your hips. Do this by sticking your butt back as
you bend your knees. Let the bar slide down your thighs to a position
somewhere in the middle of your thighs. This position we will call the

internally rotated, just as in the hang position; your arms will be
vertical; and your knees and hips will be unlocked. The bar will not be
too far down the thighs; it will be at about the middle of the thighs –
possibly higher if your arms are short or lower if you have long arms –
and </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">in contact

<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>This last point is very important, so
much so that the jumping position can be thought of as
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span

fact that you are jumping and leaving the ground. Jump as high as you
can, enough that you have to fully extend your knees and hips to do it.
Focus on your jump the first few times, and then focus on keeping your
elbows extended. It will be normal at this point to shift your feet from
the stance used for pulling into a stable position for catching the bar
in the rack position. For most people, this </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="bold">racking
stance</span></span></span><span> will approximate the squat stance
because it will be familiar from squatting, and because the bent knees
are used to absorb the weight of the dropping body and barbell best
distribute the load to the ground in this position. Don’t worry about
the stance at this point unless your feet move laterally wider than your
squat stance.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Think hard about not bending your elbows
as the bar slides down your thighs to the jumping position. Many people
will try to bend their elbows instead of letting the bar slide, but
don’t you be that person. If you find that you’re bending your elbows
anyway, use your triceps to lock the elbows in hard extension, and think
about this for a few more jumps.</span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Once the act of jumping with the bar in
your hands and with your elbows straight is firmly embedded, jump and
catch the bar on your shoulders in the rack position. Catch it in the
same place you had it before, with your elbows up. The bar should stop
on your shoulders, not in your hands. Slam your elbows up into the rack
position from the top of the jump – go from elbows-straight directly to
slammed-forward. Aim your shoulders at the bar and jam them into it
without thinking about raising your elbows, as if there is no step
between straight elbows and the rack position.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Jumping is the key. The power clean is
not an arms movement, at all, and if you first learn that a jump with
straight arms is the core of the movement, you will never learn to
arm-pull the bar. The jump generates the upward movement of the bar, and
later, when your form is good, you will think of the jump as an
explosion at the top of the pull. For now, just jump and slam the bar
onto the shoulders. Each time, be sure that 1) you start from the
jumping position with the bar touching the thighs and your elbows
straight, 2) you actually jump, and 3) you rack the bar with your elbows
up high. Check the position of the bar as it passes your chest: it
should be close enough that it touches your shirt.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>During this process, you will find that
your hands get tired, so rest them as needed. Check your eye gaze
direction, too – on the floor 12–15 feet in front of you, not straight
down and not up at the ceiling – because this important detail can get
lost in the process. It is not productive to let fatigue interfere with
concentration and good form. Take the time necessary to go through this
critical process properly.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure
6-14.</span></span></span><span> The three basic positions in the power
clean: the hang position, the jumping position, and the rack position.
</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>When you are consistently producing a
good jump and rack, you are essentially doing the “clean” part of the
power clean. The remaining task is to get the bar from the position it
would occupy loaded on the floor, up to the place on the thighs where
the jump starts. This part is nothing more than tacking a deadlift onto
the movement. It can be made more complicated than this, but it is not
productive to do so. The process of tacking the deadlift on starts at
the top and proceeds stepwise down to the floor. We will do it in three
pieces.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>With the bar close, elbows straight, and
arms rotated in, slide the bar down to the jumping position and then do
the jump and catch. This is the first step, and you’ve already done it
several times now. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The second step is to lower the bar to a
point just below the bottom of the kneecaps. Unlock your knees, shove
your hips back, and slide the bar down to a point just below the bottom
of the patellas, in the middle of the patellar tendon, above the top of
the tibias. Slide the bar down by driving your hips back, driving your
shoulders forward, and keeping your knees just a little unlocked. The
bar never loses contact with the thighs on the way down, and you might
need to think about pushing it back into your thighs so that it doesn’t
lose contact. The weight will be over the mid-foot with your shoulders
out in front of the bar, again with </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">straight
elbows</span></span></span><span>. It is tempting to unlock the elbows
as the bar slides down the thighs – perhaps the tendency is to “cock the
spring” on the way down before the jump? – but force them to stay
straight. Your chest should stay up and your low back should stay locked
in position. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>From this position just below the
patellas, slowly slide the bar back up to the jumping position, jump,
and catch the bar in the rack position. The jump will happen when the
bar reaches the place on the thighs that you will now recognize as the
jumping position. When it reaches this spot, the slow slide turns into a
jump without any pause; it will be as though the bar has touched a
trigger that trips the jump into an explosion without any hesitation at
the point of firing. During the entire movement, the bar must stay on
the thighs, touching the actual surface of the legs as it moves down and
up, until the jump. The elbows must remain straight during this sliding
along the thighs; they do not bend until after the
jump.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The second step is the hardest one
because it is the transition between the two phases of the pull: the
deadlift part and the clean part. It is the step that causes the most
trouble because the clean is just a jump and a catch, and the deadlift
involves nothing more than pulling the bar straight up at arms’ length.
This transition phase will be where you make the common mistakes that
occur in a power clean: the elbows will bend before you jump, or you
will slow down or stop the pull before you jump and catch. Maybe you’ll
do both. Keep your elbows straight by maintaining your internal rotation
and screaming at yourself “Elbows straight!” and maintain your pulling
speed until you “trip the trigger” at the jumping position. Be sure to
WAIT until the bar touches the jumping position to jump.
</span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">

<br />

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure
6-15.</span></span></span><span> If you hit the jumping position
correctly, the bar rises in an efficient vertical path. If you are
impatient and fail to wait until the bar gets up to the jumping
position, i.e. if you jump from too low on the thighs, the bar will
travel forward. This occurs because the back angle has not become
sufficiently vertical to allow the force of the jump to be directed
vertically.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>After you do this movement from just
below the knees a few times, we’ll introduce the third step of the
movement. From the hang position, lower the bar down past your knees to
the mid-shin. This is the position the bar will occupy against your leg
when the bar is on the floor and loaded with plates. Slide the bar down
the same way as before, by shoving your hips back and your shoulders
forward, keeping the bar against your thighs, and now against your shins
as well, all the way down. As the bar passes your knees, let them bend a
little to drop you into what is actually the starting position of the
deadlift. Make sure the bar is low enough, actually in the position it
will be in with plates on the bar – the tendency here is to fail to get
low enough. From there, slowly drag the bar up the shins, past the
knees, to the jumping position, and then jump and catch the bar in the
rack position. Don’t try to pull the bar from the bottom up the legs any
faster than a slow deadlift right now – there will be time for that
later. Right now, concentrate on keeping straight elbows and waiting
until the bar gets to the jumping position. The instant the bar touches
the jumping position, the jump is triggered, and not before.
</span></span></p>

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure
6-16.</span></span></span><span> Eye gaze direction should be precisely
controlled. It facilitates balance and a safe position for the cervical
vertebrae during the pull. </span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>This phase of the pull is where
impatience rears its ugly head. Most people will be anxious to clean the
bar, and one of two things will happen: the bar speed will increase
beyond a manageable speed; or the jump will happen too early – that is,
it will happen too low on the thighs, before the jumping position is
actually reached. If the bar is moving too fast at this stage in the
learning process, bar path problems will arise. It will be hard to keep
the bar in contact with the legs, and therefore in balance over the
mid-foot. Move the bar slowly now so that you can correctly move it fast
later. And if the jump occurs too early, the bar will travel forward
instead of straight up. This error will cause you to jump forward as you
catch the bar in the rack position; your feet will move forward instead
of staying in their same horizontal position. Since jumping forward is
inefficient, don’t pull early. Wait patiently until the bar touches the
jumping position and then explode into the clean. Incorrect eye gaze
direction can contribute to problems here, so check it repeatedly. Do a
few reps from this depth with the empty bar.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Adding weight to the
bar</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>When the movement is correct from the
jumping position, from below the knees, and from the mid-shin, you’re
ready for the next phase of the teaching method. Load the bar with
regulation-diameter plates that are light enough to clean from the top –
not so heavy that there is any problem with the weight at all, but heavy
enough that the bar is perceptibly loaded. For most guys in a
well-equipped gym, this will be the bar and 10 kg bumper plates. Kids
and women will need lighter plastic training plates. You will now repeat
the learning sequence from the top down. Deadlift the bar to the hang
position, drop down to the jumping position, and jump and catch the bar
in the rack position. At this point, you will see the whole purpose of
this exercise: the bar is now heavier, so what do you have to do?
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">You jump
harder.</span></span></span><span> This is why we
clean.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>After you clean the bar from the jumping
position, drop down to below the kneecaps and clean it from there.
Again, the bar never leaves the skin during the slide down and back up,
and it leaves the thighs as it touches the jumping position, not one
centimeter or tenth of a second sooner, and with no hesitation when it
gets there. After this, drop down and touch the floor with the plates
and immediately start back up the shins to the jumping position without
losing tightness at the floor. This clean will be your first official
full power clean. Do this succession of positions without a lot of
repetition at each level, so that you start learning to make each rep
count. If I were coaching you, I’d let you do only one rep at each
position. After you finish this process, set the bar down, set up a
correct deadlift with your clean grip, deadlift it off the floor, and
clean it. Do a couple reps from the floor like this. If you are wearing
weightlifting shoes with higher heels, remember to get back off of your
toes before you start the pull.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>At this point, unless there is a timing
problem or some other reason to repeat a step, all your subsequent power
cleans will be from the floor. The progression from the top down serves
to emphasize the jumping aspect of the movement, and once this is
understood and mastered, the full pull should be used. Understood and
mastered means that:</span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">

<li><span>During the pull from the floor, the bar never leaves the skin

</ol>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>As it feels better, the pull will
increase in speed from the floor, but for now, think</span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic"> slow and
correct</span></span></span><span> from the floor and </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">fast</span></span></span><span>
at the jump. Again, make sure your eyes are forward and slightly down.
An incorrect gaze direction makes a correct clean much more difficult,
and a sloppy clean can sometimes be repaired with this simple change.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Note that from the point at which the
knees unlock at the top, they do not move forward any more as the bar is
lowered to the knees, and that from just below the knees on down, they
do move forward. In other words, the hips lower the bar to the knees,
and the knees lower the bar to the floor. Coming back up is the exact
opposite movement – straighten your knees until the bar clears them, and
then return to the jumping position by dragging the bar up your thighs
as you extend your hips. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Using the hook grip
</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Within a couple of workouts, when the
movement is good enough for you to worry about peripheral matters, start
using the hook grip (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_010.html#filepos718511"
class="calibre9">Figure 6-17</a>). The hook grip is critical in enabling
heavy weights to be used. It should not be considered optional. The hook
grip should be learned before much weight is being handled in the lift.
The hook grip consists simply of laying the middle finger on top of the
thumbnail as you wrap your hands around the bar, and letting the bar
settle into the bottom of the “hook” made by the fingers. This grip
allows the bar to rest in the bend in the fingers during the pull, not
up high in the tight fist. The friction between the thumbnail and the
middle finger provides the grip security, enabling the forearm muscles
that would otherwise squeeze the grip tight to relax. This relaxing
enables the elbows to rotate faster when the bar is being racked. Most
people will release the hook as they rack the bar, due to a lack of
flexibility in the wrist. You will need to reset the hook for each rep.
</span></span></p>
<br />
<span id="filepos718511"
class="calibre1"></span>
<p><span class="calibre7"><img src="./images/00389.jpg" class="calibre8"

<br />

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure
6-17.</span></span></span><span>The hook grip. Note that the middle
finger catches the thumbnail. The friction of the finger against the
thumb is amplified by the weight of the bar squeezing the grip
components together, and it makes for a much more secure grip than grip
strength alone can produce. The hook grip also allows the bar to ride
slightly lower in the hands than does a standard grip, thus effectively
lengthening the arms just a little. </span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>After the hook grip is adopted and the
mechanics of the movement are sound, the pull from the floor can
“mature” into a more efficient movement. At first, the model is
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">slow to the
jumping position, and then fast at the jump</span></span></span><span>.
As the pull becomes more comfortable and the correct movement pattern is
more embedded, the model becomes </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">the higher the bar, the faster it
moves</span></span></span><span>. This model provides for the
acceleration needed to rack heavy weights. Start the bar off the floor
from the mid-foot, and then start pulling it faster as it comes up. The
objective is to be pulling it as fast as possible as it touches the
thighs. Since the bar speed begins to drop immediately after the jump,
the momentum you impart to the bar before this point is all it will ever
have. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Concentration is required to provide the
explosion necessary for a heavy clean, and this starts during the
warm-up sets. The bar should be slamming into the rack with light
weights, and you should be visualizing the bar moving past your chest
like a blur. This phase of the pull is where you will learn how
explosive an athlete you can be. Proper focus on this acceleration
teaches explosion that carries over into athletics. The barbell is a
marvelous concentrator of focus because there are no other factors to
distract your attention – no opponents to hit you, no ball to catch or
hit, no field of play to deal with. There is only the bar and your
ability to pull faster than you did last time, and thus to clean heavier
weights.</span></span></p>

<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>A few notes on this
teaching method</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Several things about this method make it
an efficient way to quickly learn what is usually regarded as a
complicated skill. It is possible to build into a teaching progression
several movement details which – although usually regarded as necessary
to enumerate and teach – can happen reflexively within the movement if
they are embedded in the larger pattern. The </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">shrug</span></span></span><span>
is usually coached in most power-clean teaching methods; notice that
this is the first use of the word in this chapter. The shrug is a
reflexive action that occurs as a result of jumping with the loaded bar
in the hands. In an attempt to protect the shoulders from the load in
the hands, which would otherwise pull the scapulas down as the body goes
up, the traps fire into a concentric contraction. This shrug has been
taking place since you started jumping with the bar, but it has demanded
none of your attention. Later, you can focus on the shrug to help you
rack very heavy weights, but right now, it’s already in the movement
without your having to think about it. This method allows you to focus
on developing the correct straight elbow position, jumping high, and
keeping the bar close – the more important things for a novice learning
the clean.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Another movement considered important
for an efficient clean is the “double knee bend” or the “second pull.”
<a href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_010.html#filepos721265"
class="calibre9">Figure 6-18</a> illustrates the sequence of the power
clean. Note the knee position in the first five frames: as the knees
extend in the initial pull from the floor, the shins become vertical,
placing the knees back far enough to allow the bar to come up in its
vertical path. After the bar clears the knees and as it slides up the
thighs, the knees will come forward a little to a position under the bar
as the hips extend. This motion puts the back in a more vertical
position to facilitate the jump with the bar hanging from the arms. Then
the jump occurs, and the knees and hips extend explosively. So the knees
actually extend twice – once off the floor and again at the top during
the jump – allowing the quadriceps to contribute twice to the upward
movement of the bar. Olympic weightlifting coaches refer to this
movement as the “second pull,” although “second push” (against the
floor) might be more descriptive. This movement will occur as a natural
physical consequence of your getting into the jumping position and of
having the bar touch the thighs as you jump. When you heed the reminder
to touch your thighs with the bar at the jumping position, you are
re-bending your knees to do it. So instead of thinking about a sequence
of events sometimes considered too complicated to even try to teach, you
accomplished this double knee bend by merely touching your thighs with
the bar. The more steps that are built into the method that require no
conscious direction, the more time you have left to focus on the
foundation of the movement – jumping and catching the bar.
</span></span></p>

<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Correcting
Problems</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The power clean is simply a deadlift
that accelerates into a jump, after which the bar is caught on the
shoulders. The things that make for a good deadlift must also occur in a
correct pull from the floor. At the mid-thigh, the jump occurs, and for
the barbell to fly up to the rack position with optimum efficiency, the
bar path must be as vertical as possible and directly plumb to the
balance point over the mid-foot. The elbows do not bend until after the
jump has occurred. And since the whole purpose of the exercise is power
production, the movement must be done explosively. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Stance and
grip</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Stance is chosen to maximize the force
that can be applied to the floor, while the grip is chosen to maximize
racking efficiency (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_010.html#filepos727869"
class="calibre9">Figure 6-19</a>). The stance should be the same as that
used in the deadlift. Your feet should be in the stance used for a
flat-footed vertical jump, for the same reason. We are going to rapidly
transfer force to the floor, and this stance, heels 8–12 inches apart,
is the best for this purpose. Toes will be pointed out for the same
reasons they were in the deadlift: femur and torso clearance and the
involvement of more adductor and external rotator muscle mass. Some very
tall individuals with wide hips and shoulders will need a stance wider
than this, but not many and not much wider. If wider hips seem to make a
much wider stance necessary, try using a wider toe angle first to see if
it produces the needed accommodation. Too wide a stance dilutes the
ability to jump, as is easily demonstrated by vertical jumps with
different stance widths.</span></span></p>

clean. </span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The bar will be in position right over
the middle of the foot, as in the deadlift. All major standing barbell
exercises depend on this position for balance and for force transfer to
the floor. Lining up the stance with the bar forward over the ball of
the foot creates a situation that will have to be corrected after the
bar leaves the floor, because the bar wants to ride the vertical line
over the mid-foot. If the bar doesn’t leave the ground from this
position, you will have to expend some energy to get it back there, or
the bar will be forward of the balance point all the way up. And if it
is forward on the way up, you will need a backward pull at the top to
get the bar onto your shoulders. Most lifters who chronically pull with
a backward curve in the bottom of the bar path cause this to occur by
using a stance that is too far from the bar, or by dropping their hips
and thus pushing the knees, shins, and bar forward. If the most
efficient bar path is a straight vertical line, using a start position
that enables this to happen close to the body makes for the most
efficient pull. Keep the bar close and don’t drop your
hips.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The hook grip is recommended for power
cleans as soon as the movement is comfortable, as noted earlier. When
using it, start with the warm-up sets and use it all the way up to the
work sets to desensitize your thumbs to the pressure. Very heavy
deadlifts – 800+ pounds – have been pulled with a hook grip, so power
clean loads will not be a problem. Athletic tape may help if the
discomfort is distracting or if many accumulated workouts tear up the
skin of the thumbs. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>People with longer forearms might need
to use a wider grip because the proportions produced by a long forearm
and a short humerus make a high elbow position impossible with a closer
grip. The bar must rest on the shoulders in the rack position so that
heavy weights can be used; if the forearms are too long, the bar will
rest in the hands because the elbows cannot come up enough to let the
bar down onto the deltoids (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_010.html#filepos731563"
class="calibre9">Figure 6-20</a>). The only way to functionally alter
these proportions is to widen the grip spacing to create a “shorter”
forearm, in the same way that the snatch grip or the sumo stance
shortens the functional length of their relevant segments. Some people
with exceptionally weird proportions may find the clean impossible to
rack. If this is the case, a lifetime of stretching will not make the
clean any more possible, and these people might need to learn the power
snatch as a replacement explosive exercise. </span></span></p>

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>We have discussed the mechanics of the
pull off the floor in great detail in the Deadlift section of this book.
All of that material necessarily applies to the power clean because the
relationship of the human musculoskeletal system with the barbell as it
comes off the floor </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">does not vary with the subsequent height of the
pull</span></span></span><span>. The vast majority of the Olympic
weightlifting literature that deals with the clean and the snatch
advises that the bar be pulled from the floor from a position forward of
the mid-foot, and advises that the resulting backward or horizontal bar
path off the floor is not only efficient but also desirable. This
reasoning is an example of </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">phenomenology</span></span></span><span>, “a theory which
expresses mathematically the results of observed phenomena without
paying detailed attention to their fundamental significance”
(</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">Concise
Dictionary of Physics</span></span></span><span>, Oxford: Pergamon
Press, 1978, p. 248). We are not really interested in pulling from the
floor in a manner that is demonstrably inefficient just because some
very strong elite weightlifters have been observed doing it this way –
an argument that is based on description rather than analysis. The
limitations of mechanical efficiency apply less stringently to stronger
lifters than to less-gifted lifters who have a smaller margin of error
in which to display their abilities. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>This is especially true when it is not
necessary to pull the bar in a curved path – the human body can quite
easily conform itself to the realities of gravity and mechanics and pull
the barbell up in a straight vertical path. In fact, when this happens,
the top part of the pull increases in efficiency along with the bottom
part, as we shall see. It is important to be as efficient off the floor
as possible. Most problems that develop at the top part of the pull can
be traced to an incorrect starting position and the resulting bad
initial pull off the floor.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The path the bar makes through space
from the start position to the rack position is a major factor in
diagnosing the efficiency of the lift, because it describes the
interaction of the lifter with the bar. Observe the bar path by looking
at the end of the bar from a position at right angles to the lifter,
with your eyes looking straight down the bar. Imagine that the end of
the bar traces a line in the air during the lift; this line is the bar
path, and it is very important to develop your ability to form an image
of this line. Watch other lifters do the movement, and learn to
translate the image formed of the bar path to your perception of the bar
as it moves up from the floor to the rack position.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>There are several advanced
movement-analysis instruments that record and interpret bar path
information, but none is as immediately useful in real time as the
experienced eye of a coach. The power clean is a complicated movement,
and of all the lifts presented in this program, it benefits the most
from the input of an experienced coach. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>An ideal bar path is illustrated in <a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_010.html#filepos736777"
class="calibre9">Figure 6-21</a>. If the correct position over the
middle of the foot and the correct back angle are established, the bar
comes off the floor in a vertical path as the knees straighten out, and
the back angle will be constant for at least the first few inches of the
pull. The bar follows an essentially vertical path until it reaches the
jumping position, after which it curves slightly away as the lifter’s
elbows begin to rotate under the bar. At the top, the bar path will make
a little hook as the bar comes back and down onto the shoulders in the
rack position. Individual body segment lengths and girths may vary among
lifters, but this general bar path will be observed in every correct
power clean.</span></span></p>

bar starts from a position over the middle of the foot, the bar should

<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Let’s review the angles involved in the
pull and see what varying them does to the bar path. The knee angle, hip
angle, and back angle are the same for the power clean’s pull off the
floor as for the deadlift.<br />
<span class="calibre1"></span> </span></span></p>

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure
6-22.</span></span></span><span> The angles for analyzing the power
clean are the same as for the deadlift or any pull from the floor: the
hip, knee, and back angles.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />
The correct starting position facilitates an efficient pull. For
example, when the knee angle is too closed, as when your knees are too
far forward, your back angle will be too vertical, placing your
shoulders behind the bar and your hips too low. Two possibilities exist
for the next action on the bar, and in neither of them can the bar come
up in a straight line (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_010.html#filepos740455"
class="calibre9">Figure 6-23</a>).
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>First, the bar can move forward to get
around the knees. This usually occurs only with lighter weights. Pulled
forward around the knees this way, the bar will be too far out in front
– off-balance forward – as it approaches the jumping position, and the
lifter will have to either pull it back in or follow it forward by
leaning into the bar or jumping forward at the rack position. Second,
the bar can move back toward the mid-foot as it comes off the floor.
This is what usually happens with a heavy clean. The pull starts,
balance is off forward with the weight on the toes, so the bar gets
pulled back into balance over the mid-foot. The knee angle opens and the
back angle becomes more horizontal as the bar curves back into balance
during the first part of the pull, below the knees. A common
complication of this position error is that the back angle overshoots
equilibrium with the pull, becoming more horizontal than it should. This
angle throws the shoulders too far forward and causes the bar to follow
the shoulders, again making the bar run forward of the mid-foot balance
point. Better lifters can stabilize their back angle before it becomes
too horizontal, but they won’t need to if the bar comes off the floor in
an efficient vertical path in balance over the mid-foot. The correct
starting position facilitates this balanced vertical bar path.

<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>You correct both errors (letting the bar
move forward or backward) by raising your hips and pulling the bar back
into your shins, thus putting the bar in the correct line of pull before
it leaves the floor. You might need to think about keeping your weight
back on your heels, especially if you are wearing weightlifting shoes
with higher heels. Shoes are an important piece of personal equipment,
but if they throw you into a forward position before you start the pull,
they will create more problems than they solve. Remember to get back off
of your toes and onto your mid-foot before you start the
pull.</span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>So, one extreme occurs when the knee
angle is too closed, the back angle is too vertical, the shoulders are
behind the bar, and the hips are too low. The other extreme occurs when
the knee angle is too open, the hip angle is too closed, and the back is
nearly parallel to the floor. This set of angles (much less commonly
observed due to the tendency of most people to start with their hips too
low) presents a different problem.<br />
<span class="calibre1"></span> </span></span></p>

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure
6-24.</span></span></span><span> The hips-too-high starting position.
Even with the bar in the correct place over the mid-foot, the shoulders
will be too far in front of the bar. This position causes the bar to
swing away forward to the normal pulling configuration, where the
humerus is stable at 90 degrees to the lats, leaving the bar out in
front. </span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />
Here, the quadriceps muscles of the thighs have essentially been removed
from the lift, since their job of extending the knees has already been
done before the bar leaves the floor. If the knees extend before the bar
moves, the quads contribute nothing to the first part of the lift.
Again, a starting position problem contributes to problems higher in the
pull. The back is nearly parallel to the floor, and this position places
the shoulders out in front of the bar. When the bar leaves the floor, it
swings forward to get in position under the scapulas, leaving it forward
of the mid-foot. If the pull is rescued from this mistake, then when the
bar gets to the jumping position, the knees are still too straight and
the back angle too horizontal for the lifter to jump efficiently,
because jumping requires a balance between knee extension and hip
extension that produces a vertical bar path. If the lifter’s back is too
horizontal, then as the hip angle opens, the bar swings away from the
body, in a “loop,” a classic error in which the bar goes out instead of
up. This is just one way to loop the pull in a clean or snatch. Catching
a looped clean requires jumping forward, which obviously kills your
pulling efficiency. You can easily correct the problem by adjusting your
starting position: lower your hips, squeeze your chest up, and keep the
bar against your shins as you pull.<br />

starting position (A) is getting your weight back over your mid-foot by
shifting the weight back off the forefoot and toes
(B).</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The point here is that a vertical bar
path off the floor reduces the amount of variation in the bar path
higher up in the clean. Using a start position that produces a vertical
bar path off the floor every time makes for a more easily reproducible
pull at the top, because the bar enters the second pull from a position
of balance over the mid-foot every time. The correct starting position
reduces errors and allows the lifter to focus on explosion instead of on
bar path and technique problems, as well as making the pull more
mechanically efficient.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>These examples represent the extreme
variations in starting errors, and define a gradient that will be
observed throughout people of differing anthropometry, skill, and
talent. Most starting position errors will lie somewhere along this
continuum. It is very difficult for the lifter himself to detect the
subtle variations in starting position by feel. Even elite weightlifters
experience “form creep,” in which a good starting position erodes into a
bad one over several workouts. The use of a video camera (if one is
available), so you can see the relevant angles, or the eyes of an
experienced coach are extremely helpful for holding your clean technique
together.</span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>These next comments are possibly the
most important to understand in the whole discussion of the pull from
the floor. Remember from the last part of the teaching method that the
bar accelerates from the bottom to the top, getting faster as it gets
higher. This means that the bar starts off the floor slow and gets
faster as it comes up. The entire purpose of the lower half of the pull,
the deadlift part, is to deliver the bar into the jumping position so
that it can be accelerated. It is far more important for the pull from
the floor to be </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">correct</span></span></span><span> than for it to be
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">fast</span></span></span><span>, especially at first.
Remember this: the bar must be pulled </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span
class="bold">correctly</span></span></span><span> at the bottom and
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="bold">fast</span></span></span><span> at the top. Pull the bar
slowly and correctly off the floor, then fast and close at the top. The
off-the-floor errors mentioned above usually occur when you get in a
hurry and either rush through your start position or get impatient and
jerk the bar off the floor. If you jerk the bar off the floor, you jerk
yourself out of position. If you’re out of position, you can’t hit the
jump. So </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">squeeze</span></span></span><span> the bar off the floor.
The bar always leaves the floor more slowly than it moves up the shins
and past the knees.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Any position error that is caused by
being in a hurry off the floor will be magnified on the way up, as
described earlier. Since the movement is so fast, there is no time to
correct the error. But if the bar comes off the floor slowly, your
proprioceptive skills – your ability to sense your position in space –
have time to make the small corrections that might be needed to put the
bar back in the right place before it begins moving so fast that a
correction is impossible. Control of the bar position is the whole point
of coming off the floor slowly, so that you can enter the jumping
position correctly every time. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Jerking the bar off the floor is a
common problem for people not using this method of learning the power
clean. From the starting position, many people bend their elbows a
little and then jerk the slack out of their arms in an attempt to get
the bar moving rapidly as it leaves the floor. This jerk is often
accompanied by a passive knee extension and a shift to a horizontal back
angle. This error must be identified and dealt with the first time it
happens. Pay close attention to the sounds you hear as you start the
pull: if the plates and bar rattle, you have jerked it. Several things
work to fix this. Think about “squeezing” the bar off the floor. Or
think about “long straight arms.” Or just “slow off the floor.”

<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Make sure that your eyes are looking
forward enough and not straight down, since eyes-down is often
associated with hips-up. The correct eye gaze direction – 12–15 feet
ahead on the floor – makes a correct floor pull much easier. Your
perception of back angle is affected by the positional feedback you get
from the stationary reference point you are staring at on the floor
ahead of you. This eye-gaze point on the floor gives you real-time
“telemetry” info that makes balancing much easier. Many poorly
positioned starts have been corrected quickly and easily by a cue about
the eyes.</span></span></p>

</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The part of the pull that encompasses
the transition from the basic floor pull – essentially a deadlift – into
the actual clean part of the power clean has the potential to cause the
most form problems. Errors that start on the floor get magnified in this
range, and there is plenty of potential here to start brand new ones.
Let’s examine some general principles of force transmission and see how
they apply to the power clean.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>It has been mentioned several times, to
the extent that you’re probably sick of hearing it, that the elbows must
stay straight until the jump occurs. The earlier advice to internally
rotate the arms as a reminder to keep them straight was given for this
reason. You should know not to bend the arms early, since you have
learned this in the deadlift, and the lower part of the power clean is a
deadlift. So another reminder: the function of the arms is to transmit
the pulling power generated by the hips and legs to the bar. Power is
transmitted most efficiently down a non-elastic medium, like a chain, as
opposed to a medium that stretches, like a spring. A chain transmits all
the power from one end to the other, while a spring absorbs some of the
force as it stretches.<br />
<span class="calibre1"></span> </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><img src="./images/00419.jpg" class="calibre8"
alt="079-DSC_1786.tif" /></span></p>
<br />

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure
6-27.</span></span></span><span> Bent elbows just absolutely suck. They
are one of the most persistent, hardest to correct, and most detrimental
of bad habits that a lifter can acquire. Make it a priority to learn and
keep perfectly straight elbows.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />
When the bar is pulled from the floor with bent arms, the bent elbow is
essentially a deformable component, a thing that can straighten out,
thus creating the potential for some of the pulling force to be diverted
from the bar. Little variances in the degree of elbow bend result in a
slightly variable amount of force transfer to the bar and in an
unpredictable bar path. The best clean is a highly reproducible clean –
exactly the same each time, with each rep a perfect example of lifting
efficiency. If the bar path varies with each clean, bent elbows are
often the problem. And once elbows are bent, they cannot be straightened
out during the pull; that would require the forearm, biceps, and
brachialis to relax, which they will be reluctant to do even if there
were time for you to think about it and do it.
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Your elbows might bend because you are
trying to curl or upright-row the bar with your arms. Your elbows can
rotate very fast – blindingly fast, in fact – if the muscles of your
arms are relaxed and provide no resistance to the rotation. The very
second you tighten the forearms, biceps, and triceps as you attempt to
use these muscles to move the bar, you slow the movement down. After you
rack the bar, this tightness causes the elbows to stop at the point
where these muscles reach the end of their range of motion in
contraction, which leaves the elbows pointing down and the bar sitting
on your sternum. (This is another good reason to use the hook grip. The
hook makes for a secure grip without the need to squeeze the bar with
the fingers, thus contracting the forearm muscles.)</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The same force transmission analysis can
be applied to the low back. The back is the transmission attached to the
hips/legs engine, and force generated against the ground travels up the
back, across the scapulas, and down the arms to the bar. If the low back
is not locked in hard, absolute extension, it is not as tight as it
could be. A round back is a deformable component in the same way that
bent elbows are, and it will result in the same unpredictable bar path
that is the inevitable consequence of unpredictable force transfer. If
form problems are occurring without any set pattern, this might indicate
that your low back is not as tight as it could be. Both straight elbows
and a solid back position are the basic mechanical requirements of a
technically perfect clean.</span></span></p>

<br />

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure
6-28.</span></span></span><span> The spine during the pull should be in
absolute thoracic and lumbar extension. Any softness in the chest-up
position or lower-back arch reduces the effectiveness of the back as the
transmitter of force from the hips and legs to the shoulder blades and
on down to the bar.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>As the bar approaches the jumping
position, the most important part of the movement occurs. If you are
correctly pulling the bar, it is accelerating as it moves up the shins,
sliding up your skin or your sweats. As it gets to the middle of the
thighs, the trigger trips as the bar touches the jumping position, and
you try to jump off the ground with the bar. The reaction with the
ground during this explosion produces the impulse that imparts momentum
to the bar. The knees, hips, and ankles extend simultaneously, with the
knees and hips being the primary contributors to force production. But
it is important to understand that the acceleration of the load starts
BEFORE the jump actually occurs, and this acceleration results in peak
velocity at the jump. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The leverage produced by the moment arm
of the back can be thought of in two ways. (Remember that the moment arm
along the back is the </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">horizontal</span></span></span><span> </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">distance</span></span></span><span> between the load and
the hips, not the length of the back itself.) The pessimist will view
the load hanging from the arms as moment force against the hips that
would be better configured as a shorter moment arm with a more vertical
back angle in order to take the “load” off the hips and low back. The
effective lifter will see the moment arm of the back as a tool with
which to accelerate the barbell more effectively. The same way a pitcher
throws a ball by </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">using</span></span></span><span> the moment arm provided
by the length of his forearm (no one would argue that a short arm is an
advantage to a pitcher), the lifter accelerates the bar through the
middle of the pull by </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">using</span></span></span><span> the length of the moment
arm along the back as a tool. Back strength makes this possible and is
one of the ways the deadlift is useful for heavy cleans.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The wrench analogy was used to
illustrate the concept of moment force, with the bar on the shoulders
being the force that turns the bolt, the back being the wrench handle,
and the hips being the bolt.<br />

moment arm, as illustrated by the wrench and bolt.
</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />
But in this specific application, the force gets directed from the hips
to the bar, and the moment arm is the tool used to command the bar to
move faster with the force generated by the muscles that open the hip
angle. When we squat, the muscles of the hips and back are used to
<span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">resist the
rotation</span></span></span><span> that could be produced by the loaded
bar on the way down. But when we clean, we are using the muscles of the
hips and back to </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span

back that is required to accelerate the bar upward.</span>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Remember that the human hip is a Class 1
lever. The back and the pelvis form the rigid segment; the hip joints
are the fulcrum; the hamstrings, glutes, and adductors of the posterior
chain are the force pulling down behind the hips; and the load in your
hands is the force pulling down in front of the hips (<a

Because our muscles can only contract a small percentage of their
length, our skeletal levers must multiply this distance if we're going
to move anything efficiently. This amplification of muscle contractile
distance comes at the expense of greater force production. If you are
strong enough that the force generated by the posterior chain is high
enough, the short segment behind the hip joint – the ischium of the
pelvis – can lever up the long segment, and <span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">the length of the back multiplies
the velocity of the hip rotation</span></span></span><span>.
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="bold">The short side
moving a short distance with enough force can make the long side
accelerate its load over a long distance.</span></span></span><span>
This acceleration starts during the middle of the pull, as the bar
approaches the knees, when the back angle changes to make the moment arm
between the bar and the hips much shorter. This change in angle whips
the back through perhaps 60 degrees of angle in a fraction of a second,
making the bar accelerate along with it. </span><br />

clean is used to accelerate the load hanging from the arms, taking
advantage of the “whip” that can be produced around the hips. Like the
trebuchet, a medieval siege engine that uses this same leverage
principle, we can aggressively use the leverage available along the
relatively longer back segment, instead of trying to shorten the
leverage by becoming more erect before the acceleration occurs.

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>As the angle of the back becomes more
vertical, faster, the angular velocity – the rate at which the angle
described by the plane of the back changes around the axis of the hips –
increases. As this occurs, the linear velocity of the bar hanging from
the arms increases as well. The bar hanging at the end of the arms
increases its velocity with the angular acceleration of the back angle,
just like the ball thrown from a forearm whipping through the angle it
makes when the upper arm accelerates into internal rotation.<br />

A looping bar path would take further advantage of this phenomenon as
the bar whipped away from the body. Indeed, this is one of the reasons
that a lifter loops the bar – the speed of the bar increases if it is
allowed to follow the arc of the changing angle. But the bar has to be
kept close to the body, in a vertical path, or inefficient horizontal
motion is introduced. We do this with the lats, by changing the arm
angle to maintain the vertical bar path, keeping the bar close to the
body even as the back whips through its angle to become more upright
into the jump. If the lats fail to do their job of keeping the bar
close, the lifter has to lay back with the upper body to counter the
forward bar travel; <span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">pulling</span></span></span><span> is vertical,
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">swinging</span></span></span><span> is horizontal.</span>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>And it is here that the analogy to the
jump we have used to facilitate learning the clean actually breaks down
– a little. The “whip” through the middle of the pull – using the moment
arm along the back – is what actually starts the acceleration of the
load, and this occurs well below the knees, not at the top as in a
vertical jump for height. The knees re-bend as the bar passes them to
allow the quadriceps to extend the knees a second time, but this occurs
during the process of building velocity from the acceleration which
started lower in the pull. Velocity builds during the whole acceleration
phase, from the floor to the top of the pull, not just at the top. But
during this shift from hips to knees it is typical that the increase in
velocity slows, giving many people the impression that the only fast
part of the pull is the top. The drop in bar velocity is due to the
sudden reduction in work being done on the bar as the shift occurs – for
a brief instant to acquire a better position to continue the pull, you
are moving your body instead of the bar (<a

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure
6-34.</span></span></span><span> The change in moment arm length between
the bar and the hips and the bar and the knees during the pull. As the
knees rebend, the moment arm along the femur becomes a function of the
knee extensors. (</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">M.A.= moment
arm</span></span></span><span>)</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>As the hip angle opens, the hip
extensors’ ability to accelerate the load along both the back and the
femur diminishes as the moment arm from the hip shortens. The hips lose
their ability to effective operate the “tool” we’re using to accelerate
the bar, and to continue to increase the bar velocity we have to
re-configure the levers. The knees re-bend and create leverage against
the bar from the knee backwards, now powered by the quadriceps and
adding to the velocity acquired during the middle of the pull. This
“second pull” makes use of the fact that the moment arm along the femurs
can be operated by both the knee and the hip extensors. So in some
sense, it is still a jump – “jumping” keeps the bar from swinging into a
loop. (The deadlift does not make use of this shift in leverage because
the slow velocity at which a heavy deadlift is pulled will not allow a
further loss of bar speed without actually stopping the pull and
creating an illegal “hitch.”)</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>If this re-bend is excessive, as it will
be if you try to stand up too vertically too soon, it will greatly
reduce your ability to use the angular acceleration of the back through
the middle of the pull. Excessive knee flexion slacks the hamstrings
distally, removing much of their contractile potential from the pull and
removing the posterior chain from the most critical part of the pull. A
deliberate attempt to shorten the moment arm between bar and hips by
coming into a vertical position before acceleration reveals a
misunderstanding of the leverage system used in the clean. By keeping
your shoulders out over the bar, you enable your back to whip the load
up quickly. So the acceleration of the pull actually starts before the
place we earlier identified as the jumping position. As the back loses
its horizontal angle, the knees shift into position to continue the
acceleration of the bar through to the top of the pull. This is why you
can clean more from the floor than from the hang
position.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>So there are actually two periods of
acceleration during the clean pull: the first through the middle of the
pull as the back angle whips from more horizontal to more vertical, and
the second after the knees re-bend to allow the knee extensors to add to
the bar velocity. If the first phase is performed correctly, there will
be little loss of velocity as the second phase begins. This entails the
proper understanding of the acceleration function of the first part of
the pull.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The bar needs to be in contact with your
legs during this phase, touching the skin all the way up, as you
maintain straight elbows. The path is vertical because the knees and
hips extend in a coordinated way that results in the load’s moving up in
a straight line, with as little forward or backward deviation (seen as
horizontal movement in the bar path) as possible. During this section of
the pull, forward movement of the bar is usually due to an incorrect
start, as previously discussed. Starting errors are magnified as the bar
goes up. If the bar feels like it is too far forward – if it is not
touching your thighs all the way up – check your starting position
again. Your hips may be too low, the bar may be too far forward, or you
may need to think about using your lats to actively push the bar back
into your legs on the way up.</span></span></p>

<br />

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure
6-35.</span></span></span><span> It is important that the bar be in
contact with the thighs. At this point in the pull the back angle has
become quite vertical and the knees have shifted into position to finish
the extension. The bar must move from this position upward with as
explosive and vertical a line over the mid-foot as possible, and peak
power directed correctly upward cannot be developed at this critical
position if the bar is forward of the thigh. </span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>One way to ensure that the middle of the
pull is finished correctly every time is to establish a marker for its
successful execution. If you actively try to touch the same place high
on your thighs with the bar during each rep, and develop the ability to
feel the contact point and control it, you will gain a large measure of
conscious control over the finish of the power clean. Bar contact on the
thighs is necessary for correctly meeting the jumping position, and if
you use that contact as a cue, you are much more likely to perform the
clean correctly. Using this bar contact as a cue can also increase the
speed of the clean because the bar will be hitting the thighs harder and
you will be using more extension power to cause that contact. You can
also use this contact as a diagnostic tool, clothing permitting, by
looking at your thighs to see where the red mark from the bar contact
is. You can identify pulling errors by seeing where the mark is on the
thighs in relation to where it should be for the most efficient
finish.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>At the
top</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>After the bar has been pulled up past
the knees from the correct starting position, it should assume an
essentially vertical path until it reaches the jumping position. During
this phase, the bar must remain over the mid-foot for the most efficient
power production to occur. As you jump, and your feet break contact with
the floor so you can drop under the bar for the rack, force stops being
applied to the bar. The bar path can deviate from vertical at this point
because force is no longer being produced, and the racking phase happens
after the bar has stopped its upward acceleration. Some deviation will
occur at the top due to the actions that occur while the elbows rotate
up into the rack position, and as long as the deviation is not
excessive, it will not be a problem. If it is excessive – more than a
couple of inches – something happened on the way up that caused the
deviation. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>All cleans and snatches involve the
shrugging of the shoulders, as video analysis will show. The shrug is a
concentric trapezius contraction that protects the bony anatomy of the
shoulders during the upward explosion and adds force to the pull at the
top. The scapulas are suspended from the spine by the traps and related
musculature; they hang from the muscles of the upper back, and their
only bony attachment is at the arms and collarbones. If you didn’t shrug
as you jumped up with the heavy bar in your hands, your scapulas would
be explosively compressed down onto your rib cage by the upward force of
the spine in the jump. The traps’ contraction is an involuntary reflex:
it occurs as a consequence of having the bar in your hands as you jump,
and this is why we don’t need to talk about it during the early part of
learning the clean. But later, after the weight gets heavier as you get
stronger, the shrug becomes an important cue for completing the upward
explosion against the load.</span></span></p>

and knees coming into full extension, with the traps having shrugged and
the momentum causing a rise up into plantar flexion. Any completed pull
will go through this position at the top. </span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span> The shrug occurs as you jump with a
slightly backwards-directed movement. Shrugging on a bar in front of you
has to be a little backwards-directed so that the shrug does not pull
your body forward. This keeps the system’s center of mass over the
mid-foot during the last part of the pull. Because the hips have
extended very hard and pushed the bar slightly away, and because the
elbows must rotate under the bar for you to rack it on your shoulders,
the bar path at this point may deviate forward a little from the
vertical. The point immediately before this deviation is actually where
peak power is produced. This deviation is a technique issue if it occurs
before the jump, in which case it adversely affects power production.

<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>As the bar comes up high enough that
your elbows must unlock, they begin to rotate up into the rack position.
The clean is finished as the elbows complete their rotation by coming to
a position pointing forward. During this rotation, the elbows NEVER rise
above the level of the shoulders – in fact, they never even approach the
level of the shoulders until the bar is racked. After you have stopped
applying force to the bar, at the end of the jump, your elbows unlock
and rise a short distance to the point where they are in flexion, and
then they start forward into the rack. </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="bold">The elbows bend only after the
force generated against the floor stops.</span></span></span><span>
Nothing slows a clean down more than an attempt to row the elbows up
high and lift the bar with the arms. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>There is a bodybuilding exercise known
as the </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">upright
row</span></span></span><span>, in which the bar is raised to the chin
with a narrow double-overhand grip. Most people have embedded deep in
their brains a little bundle of brain material that tells them that all
things must be lifted with the arms, especially if these things are
going to be lifted above the waist. And embedded in your mind is a
picture of a bodybuilder doing an upright row. It is a slow movement
that uses the arms and deltoids, and though it bears a superficial
resemblance to the clean, it has absolutely nothing to do with our
explosive power clean. After the bar leaves the jumping position, no
thought whatsoever should be given to the arms. None. The clean is a
jump with the bar in the hands, after which the elbows are jammed
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">forward</span></span></span><span> to catch the bar on
the shoulders. It should be as though there is no elbow activity at all
during this phase; the bar rises up in response to the jump, and then
the elbows jam forward and the shoulders jam into the
bar.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>After the bar leaves the jumping
position, it must stay close to the chest so that it doesn’t have to
travel very far back to get into the rack position. If the bar heads
away from the body between the jump and the rack, in the trajectory that
is referred to as a “loop,” the distance between the bar and the
shoulders has to be closed. You will have to do this either by pulling
the bar back in to the shoulders (possible with light weights) or, more
likely, by jumping forward to meet the bar. Neither of these motions is
efficient; any amount of force that directs the bar anywhere other than
straight up to the shoulders is wasted, because that force can be used
more productively. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>You correct a loop by first determining
why the bar is going forward. If the jump starts early, i.e., if you hit
the jumping position too low on the thighs, the bar will loop forward
due to a back angle that is not vertical enough. If the bar is to go
straight up, your back must be vertical enough that most of the hip
extension is already over before you jump; otherwise, the remaining hip
extension will swing the bar away into a loop (<a

is too low on the thighs, the bar swings away forward. This happens due
to the back angle: the finish of the pull depends on the rigid back’s
angular velocity, generated by hip extension, and if the back is not
sufficiently vertical, the force of the jump will be directed along a
non-vertical path. </span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />
You determine this fault by observing where on the thighs the bar is
when the jump occurs. Immediately after the clean, pull your sweats down
(discreetly) and look for the faint red line on the thighs where the bar
touched; the line will be visible for several seconds after the contact.
Or you can chalk the bar to make this mark more visible on the sweats
themselves (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_010.html#filepos785540"

starts consistently too low on the thighs, think about waiting longer or
touching higher before you jump.<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>If the loop occurs because you are
forward on your toes during the lower pull off the floor, your heels
will be “soft” against the floor and your knees will be forward as the

to your coach (<a

the mid-foot to start the pull, and make sure you keep your heels down
until you jump with the bar well up on the thighs. </span></span></p>

<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>If you somehow manage to loop the bar
from the correct jumping position, you may be “banging” it away from
you, off of the thighs. This rather uncommon problem is caused by not
jumping up, the movement that makes the bar climb straight up the body.
This error would occur as the result of an incorrect understanding of
the movement: the perception that the clean “swings” into position on
the shoulders, propelled by a bounce off the thighs. Our teaching method
for the power clean makes a mistake like this almost impossible, but bad
habits imported from previous instruction are often in evidence. The
emphasis on the jump and the correct use of the arms keeps the bar close
to the body on the way through the top part of the pull. You can think
about shrugging the bar at this point if you need to, or you can make
the bar touch your shirt on the way up. Keep the bar close enough to you
that you feel it on the way up as it passes your chest, and you will
have shrugged it. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Actually, if you try to touch your shirt
on the way up, this will usually correct the errors made at the bottom.
This is an excellent example of “correction displacement,” in which
sufficient attention focused on correcting an error later in a sequence
of movements unconsciously causes the correction of the initial problem
earlier in the sequence. If you manage to touch your shirt with the bar
before you rack it, you will have to get back on your heels to do it,
since the shirt is more back toward the heels than forward toward the
toes. This correction displacement trick comes in handy many times in
the weight room and throughout athletics.</span></span></p>

the bar closer to the ideal vertical bar path. Thinking about getting it
there can unconsciously correct the pulling errors that led to the
problem: the bar cannot swing away forward when you are pulling toward
the shirt, and the hips and knees cannot get in a position to swing the
bar away if you are doing what it takes to keep it close from the start
of the pull. This is NOT the same thing as using the arms to raise the
bar up to the shirt – an upright row, the most useless exercise in the
world.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>A “finished pull” is characterized by a
position common to both the clean and the snatch. The hips and knees are
in full extension; the feet are in “plantar flexion” (up on the toes);
the traps have pulled the shoulders up into a shrug; the head is in the
normal position relative to the neck, with the chin perhaps slightly up
but the neck not in overextension; the elbows are not yet unlocked; and
there is a slight backward lean (see <a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_010.html#filepos778314"
class="calibre9">Figure 6-36</a>, above). This position will be attained
if all the power of the hip and knee extension has been milked out of
the pull. It is common to fail to fully extend the hips and knees,
leaving untapped the most mechanically powerful position at the end of
the range of motion. The cue to “Finish the pull!” echoes through
training halls all over the world as coaches encourage their athletes to
get all possible power out of the jump.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Despite the fact that the fully extended
top position has the lifter up on his toes, active ankle extension is
not really a huge contributor to the explosion. The calf muscles do
contract and produce force, but the momentum of the knee and hip
extension is what actually carries you up onto your toes at the top of
the pull. Some coaches have had success with adding some calf raises
into the program, and this may work by making the lifter aware of this
component of the finished position. A cue like “Toes!” may be a useful
reminder to finish the pull by making you aware of the completed
finished position. But an active attempt to perform a hard plantar
flexion will not add much to most lifter’s clean.</span></span></p>

when the feet break contact with the floor, and this occurs as the
process of catching the bar in the rack position begins. As soon as the
feet move out of the pulling stance, you have stopped pushing the floor.
If you hadn’t, your feet could not move. The full extension of the knees
and hips is the last piece of the act of pulling the bar, and after this
final position is attained, the process is over. Even if heavy weights
could be rowed by the arms after the pull – and they can’t – the result
of the drop in pulling force would result in a drop in bar speed. The
reality is that the upward momentum of the bar quite rapidly approaches
zero, at which point the bar will begin falling. You have to catch it in
the rack position before this happens, so you’d better hurry. The faster
your feet move from the stance used for pulling into the stance used for
catching, the less time the bar has to decelerate. </span></span></p>

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure
6-42.</span></span></span><span> The transition between the pull and the
rack happens very quickly. Immediately after the final acceleration is
imparted to the bar, the direction of the body’s movement changes from
up to down as the rack position is assumed. The instant that force stops
being applied to the bar and gravity ceases to be overcome by the pull,
the weight decelerates, goes to zero upward velocity, and starts back
down, and the rack must occur before the bar falls too far. Some
downward bar movement is inevitable, but it must be minimized before the
acceleration of gravity results in high downward momentum that will be
more difficult to control.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>It is natural to move the feet from the
pulling-stance width to a position approximately equal to the width used
in the squat. This will happen naturally without your having to think
about it, like several other things we’ve discussed. It is an artifact
of having jumped, of the feet having actually left the ground and
landed. The feet move laterally outward a little so that the knees and
hips can absorb the shock of the landing. This lateral movement is
reflexive and useful. Jumping forward is not. Usually caused by a bar
path error, jumping forward wastes time and energy that could more
efficiently be used to make the bar travel up. Jumping to an excessive
width is also unproductive; excessive width takes excessive time to
cover, which means that time better spent finishing the pull was used to
perform the excessive lateral split. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>The rack
position</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>After the elbows rotate up and jam into
position, pointing forward, the bar is said to be in the rack position,
or “racked.” The upward rotation of the elbows causes the deltoids to
come into a contracted position that raises them higher than the chest,
permitting the bar to sit comfortably clear of the sternum. At this
point, most lifters will have relaxed the grip somewhat, and some will
have released the hook grip. It is okay to release the hook, or even to
let the last two fingers drop off the bar if it facilitates a good rack
position. It is not okay to completely let go of the bar, although this
does occur with some very inflexible lifters. The most important factor
in the rack position is the elbow position and its effect on the
deltoids, making a place for the bar to sit. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>This is actually the position of the bar
for a correct front squat. The correct rack position is the one that
allows the most weight to be supported on the deltoids. In the correct
position, the bar sits on the contracted deltoid muscle bellies. The
delts hold the elbows up high, keeping the weight off the sternum. The
rib cage is held up by tension in the upper back musculature, the
shoulders are elevated by the traps, and the entire trunk is held rigid
in isometric contraction and further supported by the Valsalva maneuver.
In this position, you can easily support as much weight as you can
clean.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>When you rack the bar, the best position
for the forearms relative to the upper arms is one where the humerus is
externally rotated. This means that the forearm is really beside the
humerus, as opposed to stacked on top of it (<a

<br />
<br />
It is helpful to think about lifting the elbows up <span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">and in toward the
middle.</span></span></span><span> In this position, the bar is lying on
more muscle mass, and the elbows can finish their rotation in a higher
position than they can if the bones of the forearm and the humerus are
merely stacked on top of each other. This external rotation upon racking
the bar proceeds from the internally rotated position of the elbows that
you used to reinforce the straight-elbow position when learning the
clean. The process of externally rotating the arms happens in the
transition from the jump to the rack and adds to the “snap” that the
movement should display. </span>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Many people will catch the bar with
their elbows pointing at the floor. This error is due to a
misunderstanding of the concept of the rack position, a lack of
flexibility, or a grip that is too narrow for the length of the
forearms. A sufficiently flexible trainee using a grip suitable for his
anthropometry should be physically able to get his elbows into the
correct position, although he may be reluctant to do so for various
reasons. If you rack the bar incorrectly a few times and feel it bump
your sternum because your elbows were down and the deltoids were not up
enough, you may become gun-shy and try to hold the bar up with your
hands, exacerbating the problem. Rack the bar once and then move your
elbows up into position, very high so that the bar comes up off of the
sternum. In this way you can feel where your elbows should be. If you
can’t do this, you need to stretch, or adjust your grip to a width that
facilitates the position.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Many times, a lack of wrist and tricep
flexibility prevents the quick, complete rotation needed to rack the
bar. Wrist flexibility is the more obvious of the two, but tight triceps
may also prevent the elbows from coming up high enough to permit a good
deltoid contraction. To extend your range of motion, you can stretch
your wrists and triceps, using the bar or a stick in the rack (<a

<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>If your flexibility is not sufficient to
permit the full rotation of the elbows into a good rack, the fingers
under the bar are the expendable part of the chain. After the pull has
stopped, their function as the last element of force transfer to the bar
is over. This concept is sometimes the source of confusion; the hands do
not hold up the bar, and they stop being critical to the clean after the
elbow rotation starts. So the fingers can do what they want to as you
rack the bar. They can hang on, or they can release to the extent that
only the index, middle, and ring fingers are in contact with the bar.

<br />

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure
6-45.</span></span></span><span> Under ideal circumstances, the best
grip for the rack position is with four fingers under the bar
(</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">top</span></span></span><span>). Flexibility limitations
may make it necessary to use fewer fingers, but the most important
consideration is elbow position. Do what is necessary to get the elbows
up.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>If your flexibility is sufficient but
you still cannot rack the bar quickly, you might just be reluctant to
let go of the bar enough to permit the elbows to come up. All you need
is a little relaxation of the hands and a willingness to quickly rotate
all the way up into position a couple of times to see how it feels to do
it right. Several mental tricks can help with racking speed. Imagine
slamming your elbows into the hands of your coach. Sometimes it helps to
aim your shoulders at the bar, or to hit the bar with your shoulders,
like you’re trying to strike a blow even as the elbows come up. The
crucial concept here is that the bar is not racked until the elbows
point forward, and stopping the elbow rotation before it reaches this
position is not acceptable.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>At the same time the bar racks, the feet
stomp the floor. Since the feet must break contact with the floor if a
jump occurs, they must set back down on the floor, and thinking about
stomping is a way to make this happen explosively – like everything
about the top of the clean needs to be. This foot movement causes
everything happening simultaneously with it to synchronize better. It
feels better when the feet stomp and the bar racks at exactly the same
time, and your body will time the rack to coincide with the stomp. And
if the stomp is fast, it pulls the rack along faster with it. The
simultaneity of the two events is fairly automatic, and not too many
people will stomp out of phase with the rack because it just feels too
weird. So the stomp actually sharpens the timing of the racking
movement. A certain amount of knee bend, necessary to cushion the
catching of the weight, will accompany the stomp. Catching the weight
with perfectly straight knees is not desirable and actually doesn’t
occur very often since it also feels too weird. The stomp thus makes the
movement faster, while cushioning the catch.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The feet will stomp into a position
that’s approximately the same as the squat stance, as mentioned earlier.
In practice, this should mean a couple of inches per side wider. Some
people will shift their feet out to a position wider, and perhaps much
wider, than a squat stance. This is an attempt to drop lower under the
bar, in lieu of pulling it high enough. You don’t get a good stomp going
this wide because the angle is not conducive to stomping and the
distance covered is so great that it takes too long. Stomping is quick;
lateral splitting is not. Correct this error by stomping into your
correct starting position footprints several times without the bar, and
then focus on this foot position during the clean with a lighter weight
that you can rack properly. Stubborn cases may have to actually attempt
to stomp into the pulling-stance footprints, or even narrower, in order
to get enough correction to eliminate the lateral split. A lateral split
is a bad thing to choose as a habit: it is dangerous, hard to control,
and ineffective. The purpose of the power clean is to pull the bar as
fast and as high as possible. We don’t want to make it easier to get
under the bar; we want to pull the bar higher. And if we were going to
make it easier to get under the bar, we would use the standard squat or
the split version of the clean, not some weird bastardized mutation
thereof.</span></span></p>
<br />
<span class="calibre1"></span>
<p><span class="calibre7"><img src="./images/00460.jpg" class="calibre8"

<br />

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure
6-46.</span></span></span><span> A lateral split is very common among
novices and high school athletes who have never been corrected. It is
often associated with other racking technique problems, such as bad
elbow position and leaning back. It is corrected by giving the feet a
job to do: stomp your feet back into your footprints or just a little
wider.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Another stomping error involves pulling
the heels up very high in the back and slamming them back into the
platform, as if to merely make noise. From the side it looks like a knee
flexion, certainly not an efficient part of a well-finished pull. This
is called a “donkey kick,” and it takes so much time to perform at
exactly the wrong time that it can ruin the last 10-20% of the pull.
Anything that takes away from pulling the bar as high as possible
diminishes the ability to clean heavy weights. The donkey kick is a
misinterpretation of what the feet do at the end of the pull; it will
not be a problem for you if you learned the clean using our method. It
is corrected by a conscious focus on finishing high on the
toes.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span> After you rack the bar, recover into a
fully upright stance with your elbows still in the rack position. Don’t
develop the habit of putting the bar down before you have fully
recovered and you have established control of the bar in the final
position. If you’re in a big hurry to put the bar down after you rack
it, you might soon find that you’ve gotten in a big hurry to rack it and
start racking it wrong. Disaster follows close on the heels of such
things. Finish each clean correctly.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Power cleans are not like squats or
deadlifts, movements that can be ground out to a bone-on-bone finish
through perseverance and hard work. Even if a deadlift is a little out
of position, you can lock it out by just pulling harder if you’re strong
enough. The movement is slower and there is time to fix minor form
problems before the pull is over. The clean takes less than a second to
do, and if it is not right, it doesn’t rack. Cleans can be racked only
if all the contributing factors are there: strength, power, and
technique. Since the clean is a much more mechanically complicated
movement, it is more sensitive to each contributing factor than the slow
movements are. This fact is evidenced by the experience common to all
lifters, who find that 100 kg is good for many attempts but 105
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">just will not
rack</span></span></span><span>. Finishing the pull collates all the
factors involved in the pull, and causes them all to come together at
the right time to contribute to racking the weight. The slow movements
rely on </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">absolute strength</span></span></span><span> – the simple
ability to generate force in the correct position – at their limit
capacity, while the quick lifts utilize the ability to apply maximum
power at exactly the right time, in exactly the right place. These are
two distinct skills, producing different types of training stress, and
resulting in two different types of adaptation. Recognizing this
difference between the slow lifts and the explosive lifts is fundamental
to your understanding of barbell training.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>After the
rack</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>After the clean is racked and recovered,
the bar must be dropped safely, without destroying you or your
equipment. The method used here will depend on the equipment. If a
platform and bumper plates are available, as they should be, the bar can
be dropped from the rack position in a controlled manner. Care should be
taken to prevent the bar from bouncing away from where it is dropped;
you do this by keeping the bar level on the way down. While the bar is
dropping, your hands should not leave it until just before it gets to
the floor. Bars that are released at the top and allowed to free-fall
are much more likely to bounce unevenly than bars that are tended to as
they drop. Free-falling bars are also much more likely to get bent by
the “whip” that occurs as the bar contacts the floor unevenly and the
shear force of the deceleration propagates down the length of the shaft.
Even an expensive bar can be warped this way. </span></span></p>
<br />
<span class="calibre1"></span>
<p><span class="calibre7"><img src="./images/00461.jpg" class="calibre8"

<br />

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure
6-47.</span></span></span><span> Bumper plates are designed to make the
explosive lifts safer for the lifter and easier on the bar and platform;
they absorb the shock of the drop so that the bar can be lowered by
dropping rather than through the use of an eccentric effort, as was
necessary before the invention of the equipment. But bumper plates must
be used correctly so that the bounce can be controlled. As a general
rule, don’t let go of the bar until it is just above the
floor.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>If bumper plates are not available, the
task becomes harder. The bar must be released from the rack and caught
at the hang, and then lowered to the floor, to prevent damage to the
barbell and the floor. This is actually the way all cleans and snatches
were dropped before bumper plates were widely available, so it can be
done, believe it or not. But it can be tricky, since it really hurts to
actually drop the bar right on the thighs. You have to release the bar
but retain enough grip on it to be able to slow it down before it hits
your thighs. It is decelerated with the traps, using a movement that is
the opposite of the shrug used during the jump. The bar needs to stop
here under control before being lowered on down to the floor. And if
metal plates are used, it would be prudent to use rubber mats to protect
the floor. But really, get some bumper plates. They are important enough
to consider necessary.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>The Power
Snatch</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Although it has the reputation for great
technical complexity and for being difficult to both learn and coach,
the power snatch is not any more complicated than the power clean. The
power snatch also is a jump with the barbell in the hands and a catch in
the rack position. It’s just that the rack position is overhead in the
hands, in balance directly above the shoulder joints, instead of on the
shoulders. The power snatch also obeys the laws of balance, force
transfer, and leverage. It has a longer range of motion than the power
clean, and a longer distance to travel after the force stops being
applied to the bar, so it has to be done with both lighter weight and
more speed through the jump. But it can often be done by people who
cannot rack a clean for various reasons, and the lighter weights used
make it a viable option for some training programs. Don’t be afraid of
the power snatch – it’s just not that big a deal to learn, and it is
useful enough that all lifters should know how to do
it.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The most noticeable feature of the power
snatch is the grip – it is wide, sometimes, for some tall, long-armed
people, as wide as the bar permits. This would be a sleeve-to-sleeve
grip. The width is needed to reduce the bar path’s distance; just as in
a clean, the application of force to the bar stops after the jump, and
since the bar has to fly up under the momentum imparted to it before the
loss of foot contact, it would be best if the distance the bar had to
travel unpowered could be reduced. The wide grip allows a savings of 5–6
inches over the distance of the pull, although it alters the start
position on the ground. A wide grip produces the functional equivalent
of short arms, making the lifter’s back angle more horizontal in the
starting position. You may need to compensate for this angle by pointing
your toes and knees out a little more to provide more clearance between
the thighs for the belly. </span></span></p>

<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The snatch, upon superficial inspection,
looks like it is accomplished by using the arms to lift the bar
overhead. Perhaps the wide grip fools the uninformed eye – the clean
seems easier to understand as a pull. But the movement must be
appreciated as a jump with the barbell in the hands, followed by a catch
overhead, made possible by a drop into position that straightens out the
arms. The bar is not lifted into place with the arms, and it is not
swung into place through an arc-shaped bar path. The jump carries the
bar up in an essentially vertical line if it is done efficiently, just
like every other barbell exercise performed while standing on the
floor.</span></span></p>

</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The power snatch – frequently the hang
version done from what we call the jumping position – is a favorite
exercise of post–high school strength coaches because it is a long
movement, it requires some athletic ability, and it is explosive. In
fact, the highest power outputs ever recorded in human movement are
generated at the second-pull position of the snatch. It can be done by
bigger guys who can’t rack a clean, it’s no more difficult to learn than
a power clean, and if you know how to do it already, you’ll impress the
right people in the college weight room. But it is done with lighter
weights, so it doesn’t have the potential to cause the same level of
adaptation as the clean does. The power snatch is frequently looped, it
requires enough shoulder flexibility to make an effective shrug in the
lockout position over the shoulders, and its longer bar path provides
more time to screw up, so it presents perhaps more technical challenges
than the does power clean. </span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The power snatch uses essentially the
same teaching method as the power clean, and it takes about the same
amount of time to learn. Again, we learn the movement from the top down,
perfecting the jump and the catch in the rack position, and then tacking
the deadlift onto the front of the movement off the floor.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>So, we’ll start the same way, with the
empty bar in the hands at the top of the pull. This will be the
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="bold">hang
position</span></span></span><span>, just as in the clean. The hang
position will be the default position for holding the bar between reps
while you’re learning to perform the movement. Again, a PVC pipe or a
broomstick is too light to learn to pull anything with, and you need to
have the right equipment if you want to lift weights. Women really
should consider the smaller-diameter 15 kg bar if snatching is in the
program; their usually smaller hands have a hard enough time making a
grip at the angle at which they meet the bar in a snatch. For men, any
20 kg bar will do for right now. It is true that Olympic weightlifting
bars are better for the snatch and the clean and jerk at heavy weights,
but for novices learning the movement, most any bar will work well
enough.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The snatch grip has been described by
many authors as being derived from some percentage of arm length, with
measurements taken and the bar marked. The reality of the situation is
that everybody will adjust the grip to a position that works for them,
no matter how much precision was used in originally determining the
grip. And what works will be determined by where the bar strikes you as
you jump. If your grip is too narrow, you lose the advantage of using a
wide grip (duh), and if it’s too wide, you hit yourself in the hip
pointers. So the optimal grip will place the bar somewhere between the
anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) and the pubis for everybody (<a

<br />
<br />
The best way to set the grip is to stand up with the bar and slide your
hands out wide (and obviously overhand) to a point near the sleeves
where the bar rests against your lower belly, just below your hip
pointers and just above your pubis. This placement gives you a range of
a couple of inches on your belly, and about an inch either way at the
hands. When in doubt, go wider, since the point is to shorten the bar
travel. After setting your grip, refer to the bar markings and spot your
position so that you can duplicate it quickly and precisely every
time.<br />

the hand at an angle that minimizes the contact between the ring and
little fingers and the bar. The hook is the primary holding mechanism in
the snatch. </span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Go ahead and use the hook grip you
learned earlier in the clean. This grip width will result in a rather
acutely angled hand position on the bar, so that the thumb, index
finger, and middle fingers do most of the gripping, with little
contribution from the ring finger and little finger. This angle makes
the use of the hook grip more important for the snatch because fewer
fingers must do most of the work of holding the bar. You already know
how to make the hook from doing it for the clean, so you should not have
a problem adding it now. Chalk is important, too, and any gym that lets
you snatch shouldn’t have too big a problem with a little judiciously
applied MgCO3.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Once your grip is set, note the position
of the bar against your belly. It should be in contact with the skin
when you are standing erect, with chest up, elbows straight and
internally rotated, knees and hips extended, and eyes looking forward
and slightly down at the same point 15 feet away on the floor. Your
stance right now will be the standard pulling stance used for the clean
and the deadlift: heels 8–12 inches apart and toes pointed slightly out.
We’ll modify the stance later.</span></span></p>

<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The internally rotated elbows are
important. They are your reminder to keep your arms perfectly straight
during the pull. When you set your grip, set your arms into position by
rotating them the way you would if you were standing with your palms
facing the floor, and then pointing your thumbs down at the ground.
Later, when you rack the bar at the top, the racking motion will involve
rotating the arms externally, the opposite direction. This rotation
provides much of the “snap” that is characteristic of racking a
snatch.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The next position is the
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="bold">rack
position</span></span></span><span>. The snatch racks overhead, just
like the top position of the press but with a wider grip. The bar is in
balance when it is directly over the shoulder joints, since that is the
point at which no moment arm exists between the load and the point of
rotation. The rack position has nothing to do with your head or your
neck, especially considering the fact that your neck can move around
quite a bit under the racked bar. In this position, the bar, the
shoulder, and the mid-foot will be vertically aligned, something that is
very important when the weight gets heavy. </span></span></p>

<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Get the bar in position over your head
with your snatch grip any way you have to, and don’t let go of your
hook. Your arms must be perfectly straight. They will go from internally
rotated in the hang position, to externally rotated overhead. If you
point the palms of your hands directly at the ceiling, you will produce
this position. Holding onto the hook prevents the bar from rolling back
into the fingers to make a long moment arm between the bar and the
wrists. Some leverage is inevitable, but the hook keeps it from getting
excessive. </span></span></p>

in the web of the thumb (B) prevents the load from being correctly
supported by the arms and places the elbows in a potentially dangerous
internally rotated position. </span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>After the bar is in position overhead,
make sure it is in balance over the shoulder joints. Push the bar back a
little to feel the posterior extent of your balance; then bring it
forward until you feel the weight start to pull the bar forward. The
balance point is right in the middle, where the rotation force on the
shoulders is neutral. For most people, this position will be a little
behind where they think it should be, especially if they have been told
to keep the bar over the top of their head. During this process, the
elbows remain perfectly straight. </span></span></p>

vertically aligned with the glenohumeral joint. Any distance forward or
behind this point will be a moment arm that will have to be handled.
</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Once the balance point has been
identified, the final part of the rack position is added. Shrug your
shoulders up, like you are reaching for the ceiling with the palms of
your hands. Shrugging the traps in the rack position recognizes their
anatomical role as the main supporters of the scapulas, and thus the
bar. Think of it as though the delts and triceps are holding the arms
straight and the traps are holding the bar up. The shrug also allows the
rack position to be met with a solid base of upper-body support; instead
of just holding up the bar with your arms, you’ll be supporting it with
the strongest muscles in your upper back. Remember that your palms are
pointing at the ceiling, your elbows are perfectly straight, and your
eyes are looking forward and slightly down.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Lowering the bar from the rack position
correctly at first is an important way to teach yourself more about the
bar path in the snatch, starting from the very beginning. Just as we did
in the clean, we’ll start practicing a close, vertical bar path from the
very beginning, preparing early for what comes later. Barbells are in
balance when they are directly over the mid-foot, so when you lower the
bar from the rack position, keep it there: unlock your wrists and let
the bar fall straight down past your face and chest, and then catch it
at the hang position. Wrists were the last things to extend on the way
up, and they are the first things to unlock as you drop the bar back
down. As it falls straight down, in balance over the mid-foot even with
the light weight of the empty bar, you begin the process of learning
that </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="bold">arms do not
power the snatch</span></span></span><span>. They don’t lower the bar,
either – the bar falls and you catch it. Don’t try to slow it down with
your rowing muscles, but rather just cushion the fall with bent knees
and hips. Aim for your nose the first couple of times to learn how close
the bar can actually stay on the way down. Make it touch your shirt
after it falls past your face – not by slowing the bar down with your
arms but by keeping it close from the top as it falls. It helps here to
actually think about the mid-foot and the slot directly over it in the
air that you drop the bar into. You will still have your hook grip, so
you won’t lose the bar as it hits the hang position. Practice this a few
times. </span></span></p>

<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The next position is the
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="bold">jumping
position</span></span></span><span>, just like the clean again but with
one important difference. In the clean, the bar leaves the thighs at
this last point of contact somewhere in the mid-thigh, where the knees
and hips have unlocked, the bar is touching the skin, and your elbows
are straight; the jumping position is both the knees/hips-unlocked
position </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">and</span></span></span><span> the point on the thigh
where this occurs. In the snatch, the jumping position is just the
knees/hips-unlocked position because the bar will slide up to touch the
belly with straight elbows before it leaves the body. </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="bold">The jumping position for the snatch
is the belly – the same as its hang position – not the thigh like the
clean.</span></span></span><span> </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Unlock your knees and hips, just like
you do for a vertical jump or standing broad jump. As you do this, slide
the bar down the thighs, never letting it leave contact with the skin.
It is common to bend mostly the knees here, which will leave the
shoulders behind the bar. The involvement of </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">both hips and
knees</span></span></span><span> in the jump is critical, since two
joints extending explosively generate more power than just one. If both
joints are unlocked, the shoulders will end up directly over the bar
with it this far up the thighs. (The shoulders go forward of the bar,
into the standard pulling position, when the bar gets lower.) The elbows
are still straight and internally rotated, eyes are looking forward and
slightly down, and feet are in the pulling stance.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>From this position of contact on the
thighs, slide the bar up to the belly and jump as high as possible. This
should be a smooth motion that accelerates as the bar slides up. Before
it leaves the body on the way up, the bar touches the same place on the
belly that it did in the hang position. As you leave the ground, make
sure your elbows are straight and that you’re jumping as high as you
can, high enough that you have to fully extend the knees and hips to do
it. A good jump will leave the toes pointed at the floor, not because
you performed a calf-raise as a part of the explosion but because the
explosive extension carried you up onto your toes. This knee and hip
extension is what makes the bar touch your belly, so make sure the touch
occurs. Don’t worry about the elbows the first few times – just jump
high with straight elbows.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>When your jump with straight elbows is
working, jump and catch the bar in the rack position. Keep the bar close
to your chest on the way up, and let the elbows bend </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="bold">after the
jump</span></span></span><span> to facilitate this. If you bend your
elbows before the jump, you will dilute the power being transmitted down
the arms to the bar (remember towing the car with a chain vs. a
spring?), and the tight biceps will slow down the rotation that must
occur to rack the bar. If you try to keep the elbows straight
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">after</span></span></span><span> the jump, the bar will
swing away forward into a loop. So you must eventually bend your elbows,
along with your wrists, but not until after you jump. If you just think
about catching the bar in the rack position, your elbows and wrists will
perform in the correct order. </span></span></p>

</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The elbows snap from internal rotation
to external rotation as the elbows and wrists unlock after the jump and
then relock in the rack. This unlocking after the jump permits the bar
to fly up past the chest and face, staying close to vertical over the
mid-foot. The unlocking of the two joints allows the arms to behave like
the links in a chain that connects the shoulders to the bar. The jump
provides the power that elevates the bar and propels it up with enough
momentum to carry it through the unpowered part of the pull to the rack
position. The arms merely connect the back to the bar to transmit this
power; they generate none of their own.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The final part of the snatch is the
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="bold">drop</span></span></span><span> that straightens out the
wrists and elbows at the top. As you feel yourself rise to your toes as
a consequence of the jump, and the bar flies up past your chest and
face, drop under the bar. This drop is a bending of the knees and hips
again, perhaps back to the same position from which you jumped. This
time they just unlock, to permit you to catch the bar with straight
elbows in a cushioned position. It is the drop that finally straightens
the elbows and wrists as your hips and back move down – not your muscles
pulling the bar up into this final position (an assistance exercise, by
the way, known as a “muscle snatch”). </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The drop provides the final snap that
permits the external rotation of the arms into the rack position, and
the speed of the last 10% of the snatch depends on your commitment to
drop under the bar and catch it with straight arms. The movement should
be fast enough to cause the bar to audibly rattle as you rack it – make
it slam into position as you drop. To make the movement quick and sharp,
you might want to think about “stabbing” your hands up into the bar as
you drop. Practice this a few times, and then set the bar down to rest
your hands.</span></span></p>

class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure
6-58.</span></span></span><span> The 3 teaching positions: hang, jump,
rack. </span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Remember to lower the bar by unlocking
your wrists first and catching the bar as it falls past your chest. You
do not un-press a snatch any more than you use a press to raise the bar
into the rack position. If you have pressed it into position, then the
wrists have extended before the elbows, the jump was not the force that
carried the bar up, the drop has not explosively rotated and
straightened the elbows and wrists, and the movement has been very slow.
Many people have been allowed to raise the bar the final few inches with
the wrists already turned over, and their mental picture of the movement
is consequently quite incorrect. And it won’t matter how fast you can do
it wrong – if you lose the last piece of jumping explosion by trying to
turn the bar over early to press it with a snatch grip, you lose the
power from the last part of the jump and you lose the speed from the
drop. Unlocking the wrists first to lower the bar from the beginning
stops this problem before it starts.</span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Once you’re catching the bar in the rack
position with a drop and a snap of the elbows and wrists, you’re doing
the basic snatch movement. The next part will again involve getting the
bar from the floor up to the jumping position, and again the deadlift is
the most efficient physical model of a pull from the floor. We’ll start
at the top. From the hang position, slide the bar down into the jumping
position, slide it up as you jump, and catch it in the rack position a
couple of times. Then slide the bar down to the position just below your
kneecaps, below the joints but not much below the very top of your
shins. Slide the bar up slowly until it reaches the mid-thighs, and then
accelerate it up and jump, making sure to touch the belly and to keep
straight elbows when you jump. Do not stop at the mid-thigh position –
treat it like a “trigger” for the acceleration, just as you do in the
clean, so there is no pause in the pull. Rack the bar, unrack it, and
repeat the snatch from this position a couple more times. Set the bar
down if you need to between these steps; the snatch can be hard on the
hands. </span></span></p>

way down to the floor. </span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The mistake you’re going to make here
will be letting the bar lose contact with the thighs, either just above
the knees or at the mid-thigh. If you get in a hurry and lose patience
with the pull, the usual result is an early jump, well below the correct
level. This inevitably carries the bar, and you, forward. Or you might
think that the bar actually leaves the thighs at the jumping position,
but this is a misunderstanding of the motion. Drag the bar up in contact
with the skin, never leaving the thighs. The bar must be in skin contact
until it leaves your belly for an efficient vertical bar path. Take your
time, and remember that fast happens at the top, not at the bottom or
even in the middle, at first.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The next position will be at the
mid-shin, where the bar would be if it were loaded with plates on the
ground. This position will challenge your ability get into a good,
mechanically correct deadlift – with shoulders in front of the bar and
the back in hard extension – because of the width of the grip.
Compensate for this more horizontal back angle by making sure your knees
are out enough. </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="bold">Most people will touch the inside of their elbows with the
outside of their knees if they are correctly set
up,</span></span></span><span> with contact similar to the deadlift
start position. This knees-out position gets the thighs out of the way
of the belly, and makes the more-horizontal back angle easier to use.
Make this a feature of the start position from this point forward: reach
out with your knees to touch your elbows before you squeeze up into the
pull. Toes-out enough makes knees-out much easier, so adjust your stance
now if your feet haven’t already sorted this out for themselves. From
this position, </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">slowly</span></span></span><span> pull the bar up the
shins as the knees extend, then past the knees, and up to the mid-thigh,
staying in contact with the skin for the whole pull. When the bar gets
to mid-thigh, accelerate into the jump and rack the bar.

would be loaded with plates on the floor. </span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Most people tend to pull the snatch too
fast off the floor. Even after the movement has been learned correctly,
the tendency will be to hurry through the “floor pull,” the first part
of the pull from the floor. Make up your mind now that the first part
will be slow and correct, and that the explosion starts only after the
bar is in the higher part of the pull. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>At this point, you are doing a full
power snatch. Rest a second, and put some light plates on the bar. The
power snatch is best practiced with light plates at first, especially if
you are not already pretty strong. “Light” may mean lighter than the
commonly available 10 kg bumper plates. If this is the case, they will
need to be obtained. They tend to be expensive, and their lack of
availability may be a deciding factor in using the power snatch for
trainees who cannot easily manage a 40 kg load. If they are available,
use them; they make the process of learning to jump with heavier loads
much more seamless than does an abrupt jump from 20 kg to 40 kg. Too big
a jump here often results in an arm pull and a complete breakdown in the
careful progression we have detailed. Go up slowly and convince yourself
that the snatch is a jump with straight elbows that ends with a drop,
not a panic-stricken retreat into a wide-grip upright
row.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>When the snatch is up to 40 kg on the
bar loaded with bumper plates, most people drop the bar from overhead to
the platform in one movement, letting the rubber do its job. Before the
invention and widespread availability of bumper plates, snatches had to
be lowered eccentrically. This requirement added another dimension to
the workout that was probably beneficial, if less fun. If you have the
luxury of bumper plates, learn to use them correctly. Drop them from
overhead while precisely controlling the drop by not letting go of the
bar until it is close to the floor. Make sure that the plates land
evenly if at all possible; an uneven drop can bend even the best bars.
It is fashionable in some circles to drop empty bars from overhead or to
let go of a dropped bar from overhead. These circles can go somewhere
else to train, because equipment is expensive and the gym must be
respected as a place where you control your immature urges to call
attention to yourself. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The power snatch is best trained with
doubles – sets of two reps – or singles. The pull is long, it is
sensitive to fatigue, and sets of, say, five reps will cause you to
start making mistakes that would not happen were you not fatigued.
High-rep sets will very quickly have you practicing sloppy snatches. If
your workouts entail more incorrect reps than correct ones, you will get
highly proficient at doing them wrong. So limit yourself to two-rep
sets, and accumulate workload by doing multiple sets instead of doing
too many reps per set.</span></span></p>

Assistance Exercises</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<hr />
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The squat, bench press, deadlift, press,
and clean form the basis of any successful, well-designed training
program. But there are other exercises that can assist these five and
improve certain aspects of their performance.</span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>There are, quite literally, thousands of
exercises that can be done in a well-equipped gym. Bill Pearl, in his
classic text </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">Keys to the Inner Universe,</span></span></span><span>
includes cursory descriptions of 1621 exercises. Not all of these
exercises are useful for strength training purposes, though, because few
of them actually contribute to the performance of the core barbell
exercises.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>This point is important for a couple of
reasons. Your training priorities, which should depend on your
advancement as an athlete, should involve strength, power, or mass. No
matter how long you train, or how strong, explosive, or big you get,
your training will always be tied to the performance of these basic
movements or their derivatives. The fact that resources – time,
recovery, the patience of family and friends – are always in shorter
supply than we’d like makes the efficiency with which your goals are
accomplished an important consideration. The best assistance exercises
are those that directly contribute to the performance of the basic
movements that produce the most benefit. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Not that the basic movements need much
help. They are complete exercises in and of themselves, since they all
involve lots of muscles moving lots of joints in anatomically normal,
functionally useful ways. But after a certain period of time, usually
several months after serious training begins, the stimulation provided
by the execution of the basic exercises alone is not enough to produce
sufficient stress to cause further adaptation. This change is due not to
any deficiency in the basic exercises but to the trainee’s ability to
successfully adapt to the stress these exercises provide. A natural
result of training is that progress slows down after progress has been
made, and progress is why we train. These topics are discussed at great
length in </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">Practical Programming for Strength Training, Second
Edition.</span></span></span><span> </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>For example, an excellent assistance
exercise for the bench press and the press is the chin-up. Chin-ups add
enough work to the triceps, forearms, and upper back that the
contribution of these muscle groups to the bench press is reinforced for
the trainee who needs a little extra work. And this work is done using
another multi-joint functional exercise. In fact, chin-ups are so useful
that they are included in the program from very early on as the only
non-barbell component of the program. A less efficient way to accomplish
the task would be to add a triceps isolation movement like cable triceps
extensions, a machine-based movement that, when done with what is
usually considered strict form, leaves out the lats, upper back,
forearms, posterior deltoids, biceps, and grip strength. Since the bench
press uses all these muscles, why lose the opportunity to train them all
together at the same time with another multi-joint exercise? Chin-ups
work better as an assistance movement, as do heavy lying triceps
extensions, an exercise that actually is more beneficial when performed
with what would conventionally be interpreted as less-than-strict form.
</span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Before we get started, let’s discuss
adding exercises to your program. Anytime a new movement is introduced,
be conservative with the weight you use the first time you do the
exercise. This is a lesson you will learn the hard way eventually, but
it’s better to learn it now. Anytime you try a new exercise, you will be
working with a movement pattern or a piece of equipment that you have
not used before. Even if you are using a partial range of motion from a
familiar exercise, you have not used that piece of the movement by
itself before. You have previously used it in the context of the whole
movement, and working it separately is a different mechanical task than
the whole movement – it is sufficiently different that you have chosen
to do it that way instead of the other way. You are not adapted to the
new exercise, and as a result it will make you sore, perhaps very sore.
This soreness may be due to the simple fact that you are doing a
different number of reps with the assistance exercise than you use for
the parent movement. A rep range to which you are not adapted will make
you sore, too. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>But a brand new movement pattern has the
potential to go beyond simple soreness. It is one thing for unadapted
muscles to get sore, and quite another thing for unadapted joints to get
sore. Sore joints usually mean inflammation, if not outright structural
damage. Sore muscles mean inflammation, too, but muscle bellies are
vascular – supplied with lots of vessels and capillaries that carry
blood to help them heal quickly – whereas joints are not. Joint soreness
is a much more serious matter than muscular soreness or even muscular
injury. Joint problems can persist for years, while muscle belly
injuries will heal in a matter of days or weeks. And lots of sore joints
start on the day you try something new with as much weight or as many
reps as you can do with it.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>This is not to suggest that you be a
weenie. It is to suggest that you be intelligent and prudent with new
exercises so that you don’t end up being an </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">involuntary</span></span></span><span> weenie later. This
point is especially important if you are an older trainee. Start a new
exercise with a good warm-up, and only go up as heavy or to as many reps
as you would consider being equivalent to a moderately heavy warm-up
set, leaving something on the bar for next time. This way, there can be
a next time soon enough that you can proceed to make progress on the new
exercise, instead of having to wait for something to
heal.</span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Assistance exercises fall into three
categories. These exercises 1) strengthen a part of a movement, as with
a partial deadlift (either a rack pull or a halting deadlift); 2) are
variations on the basic exercise, as with a stiff-legged deadlift; or 3)
are ancillary exercises, which strengthen a portion of the muscle mass
involved in the movement in a way that the basic exercise does not, as
with the chin-up. All assistance exercises of value can be assigned to
one of these three categories.</span></span></p>

Movements</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The deadlift, as mentioned earlier, can
be a brutally hard exercise. When done with very heavy weights, as a
very strong trainee would use, deadlifts can become very hard to recover
from during the period of time called for in the program. A limit set of
five in excess of 500 pounds might require a week or more for adequate
recovery for the next workout, and in the meantime squats have suffered
as well. When your deadlift gets strong enough that heavy sets of five
create more stress than you can easily recover from within the timeframe
of your training, it becomes useful to alternate two assistance
exercises instead of the deadlift. </span><span><span

href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_011.html#filepos861873"
class="calibre9">Figure 7-1</a>) is done with a double-overhand grip and
from the same stance as the deadlift. Like deadlifts, haltings are
pulled from a dead stop. A brief review of pulling mechanics might be
useful here; refer to <a
href="#filepos421988"
class="calibre9">Chapter 4</a> if necessary. The knee extensors move the
load up from the floor; the hamstrings and glutes maintain the back
angle while this happens; the hips then extend; and the spinal erectors
keep the spine rigid in extension so the transfer of force from the
knees and hips to the bar can occur efficiently. The traps and rhomboids
transfer this force to the scapulas, from which the arms hang, and the
lats keep the arms back so that the load stays in position over the
mid-foot during the trip from the floor to the top of the knees and back
down.</span></span></p>

</span> The bottom (A), middle (B), and top (C) positions of the halting
deadlift. </span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Take a normal deadlift stance and a
double-overhand grip of the same width as for a deadlift. Lift your
chest and lock your back into extension, using the normal deadlift setup
discussed in Chapter 4. In a deadlift, the back angle will start to
become more vertical as the bar approaches the tibial tuberosity, the
enlarged bump at the top of the shin, a few inches below the patella.
Haltings are a little different in that you actively try to hold the
back angle constant as the bar passes this point, so that the back gets
worked harder through what would be the middle of the full deadlift. Try
to keep your shoulders in front of the bar until it crosses the
patellas. The back angle will probably change before the bar gets to the
patellas, but your job is to deliver as much work to the erectors and
lats as possible by staying out over the bar as long as you can. This
extra back work is one of the reasons for the exercise. The amazing part
of this exercise is how much work the lats get while doing their job of
holding the weight in position over the mid-foot.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Drag the bar up your shins until the
patellas are just cleared, and then set it down. Don’t worry about
setting it down slowly, since the work on a halting is supposed to be
mostly concentric. Remember: you’re starting each rep from a dead stop.
Bill Starr would tell you to hold the bar at the top position for a
second before setting it down, and doing so adds greatly to the effort
required of the back muscles and lats. It is very helpful to think about
1) pushing the floor with your feet, 2) pulling the bar back into your
shins as it comes up, and 3) keeping your shoulders out over the bar for
as long as you can pull it that way. Breathing is the same as for the
deadlift; take a big breath before you pull, and hold it until you set
the bar back down. Start with 135 pounds and take reasonable jumps up to
your work-set weight. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>You will not do haltings in the same
workout as the deadlift, so you will not be warm when you start them, as
you might be with a smaller-muscle-group assistance exercise done after
the core movement. Haltings should be warmed up just like deadlifts.
Haltings seem to respond well to higher reps, but due to their shorter
range of motion, work sets of, say, eight reps will use heavier weights
than a deadlift work set of five will, and possibly as high as 85% of
1RM. At this load, one work set is plenty.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Breathing takes place at the bottom, and
is the biggest problem during the exercise due to the bent-over
position; the last reps of a long set are no fun when you’re out of air,
and you can’t really get a good breath in the start position. The grip
is a straight double-overhand, or clean, grip, as mentioned earlier.
Supinating one hand for a heavy single deadlift is a necessary evil in a
meet, but multiple reps with one shoulder in internal rotation and the
other in external rotation produce an asymmetric shoulder stress that
some people do not tolerate well. Haltings are very good for developing
the grip, since you won’t be using your 1RM deadlift weight for them,
and the double-overhand grip is harder than the alternate grip, so use
the halting as a grip exercise, too. If you get strong enough that your
grip strength is exceeded, then you can either use straps or switch your
alternate grip, changing the supine hand each rep. This change is a
little trouble, and straps are fine if your grip is otherwise strong
enough, i.e., you don’t normally have any trouble hanging onto heavy
deadlifts.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Pay attention to keeping the bar against
your shins on the way up – this is the lats’ job. Haltings can be
thought of as “pushing the bar away from the floor with the feet” at the
bottom, and almost as a row at the top as the bar breaks over the knees.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Rack
pulls</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Rack pulls are the other half of this
pair (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_011.html#filepos868352"
class="calibre9">Figure 7-2</a>). They are done from inside the power
rack, from level pins set at a point somewhere below the knees. How far
below the knees the pins are set determines the amount of overlap that
the halting and the rack pull have with each other. Just below the
patellas is probably not enough, while down to mid-shin defeats the
purpose of dividing the whole pull into two movements. Three or four
inches below the joint line is about right, just below the tibial
tuberosity. The point of the halting deadlift is to work the initial
drive off the floor, which depends heavily on the quads for the drive
and on the hamstrings to anchor the back angle. The rack pull should use
as little quadriceps drive as possible, with the main emphasis on hip
extension – working the hamstrings and glutes, and above all, keeping a
flat back while this happens. With hip extension as the primary point of
the exercise, rack pulls are obviously also done from a dead
stop.</span></span></p>

</span></span></span><span> The start (A), middle (B), and finish (C) of
the rack pull. </span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Your stance for the rack pull will be
the same width as for the deadlift, but with your shins more vertical
than they’d be in the start position off the floor. The bar should be in
the position it would be in were it deadlifted to that height off the
floor – bar over mid-foot and in contact with the shins, just barely
below the knees. Your shoulders should be in front of the bar, and it is
very important that they stay there until the bar is well up your
thighs; in this respect, both haltings and rack pulls differ from
deadlifts, which allow the natural change in back angle to occur when
the bar is below the knees. Your back must be locked hard in both lumbar
and thoracic extension – the chest is up, and the lower back is arched
but not overextended – a normal anatomical position of extension, the
position described for the squat and deadlift and for all barbell pulls.
It is easier to get in this position when the bar is higher up the shins
because less hamstring tension is pulling on the pelvis/lumbar lock at
this point. As with the halting deadlift, the rack pull is performed
with a double overhand grip, usually with straps due to the heavy
weights used.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>From the starting position, drag the bar
up your thighs, keeping it in constant contact with the skin, with your
shoulders out over the bar, your chest up, and your knees held in
position with no forward movement. When the bar is high enough up the
thighs that you cannot keep your shoulders forward, extend your hips
forcefully – “shoot the hips” is a good cue for this movement. The
finish position is the same as for a deadlift, with shoulders back,
chest up, knees and hips straight, and eyes focused on the floor about
12-15 feet ahead. No exaggerated shrug is necessary or useful; the hips
are shoved forward into extension with the chest held up, and this is
all that needs to be done at the top. Breathing is also the same as for
the deadlift, with a big breath taken and held before each rep. Sets of
five work well for rack pulls. The weights that can be used are quite
heavy, due to the shorter range of motion, and it is not uncommon to do
a 5RM rack pull with very close to 1RM deadlift weight. Again, they
should be warmed up with the same progression as for a deadlift.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>As simple as this movement sounds, it is
very easy to do wrong. Most people will allow their knees to come
forward as soon as the bar passes them, making the back angle more
vertical and dragging the bar back up the thighs along an angle – and
supporting some of the weight on the thighs – instead of keeping the bar
path vertical. This knee shift is illegal in the deadlift in a
powerlifting meet, since the bar will actually go down a little, and it
is referred to as a “hitch.” Your body wants to do this for the same
reason the second pull on a clean works: you get a second opportunity to
use the quads to straighten out the knees if you re-bend them. But
unlike a clean, the rack pull is specifically used to strengthen the
hamstrings, and they must be made to do their job as intended to pull
the hips into extension while the back stays flat. It is important to
stay out over the bar, keep the knees back, keep the bar on the legs,
and extend the hips only after the bar is well up the thighs.

<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Barbell
shrugs</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">barbell
shrug</span></span></span><span> is a type of rack pull that starts up
above the knees, at about the point where the hips shoot forward at the
very top of the deadlift. Barbell shrugs can be done with very heavy
weights, 100 pounds over your PR deadlift or more, due to their very
short range of motion and good leverage position. In fact, to be
effective, barbell shrugs must be done very heavy. But they are an
advanced exercise, and not everybody should do them. The fact that they
are done so heavy means that a novice lifter unadapted to heavy weights,
in terms of bone density, joint integrity, and motor control, can become
very injured very quickly even when doing them correctly. An impatient
friend of the author broke the spinous process off of C6 doing these
prematurely. Barbell shrugs (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_011.html#filepos874161"
class="calibre9">Figure 7-3</a>) are best left for competitive lifters
who have trained for at least a couple of years, and there is no real
reason for athletes who are not powerlifters or weightlifters to do them
at all. They are included here for the sake of completeness, lest anyone
think that they do not exist.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure 7-3.
</span></span></span><span>The barbell shrug.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>If you are sure you’re ready, set your
rack pins at mid-thigh and load the bar inside the rack to 135 pounds. A
shrug is done like the top part of a power clean, and the best warm-up
for a shrug is racking the bar on the shoulders with 135 from this high
position. This warm-up establishes the correct movement pattern for the
subsequent heavier sets and weeds out the novices: if you cannot easily
hang-clean 135 from a dead stop on the pins, you have no business doing
heavy shrugs. After a couple of sets of five at 135, add another big
plate and try to clean it for five. If you can, good; if you can’t, you
have shrugged it. The mechanics of the movement should be the same as
the second pull of the clean, the heavier weight limiting your ability
to rack the bar on your shoulders but with the rest of the movement
intact. As the weight goes up, the bar will travel less and less, until
for the last warm-up and the work set, the elbows do not even unlock and
only the hips, knees, and shoulders move. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The point of this heavy load is to make
the trapezius muscles finish what the hips and legs have started. The
key to the movement is the snap that must be used to make the traps work
at the top. The bar will start up slowly from the pins, and you will
have your chest up, your low back locked VERY tightly, and your elbows
straight; then you will shrug your shoulders back explosively, as if to
touch the top of your traps to the back of your skull. Now, this does
not mean that the head moves back – it means that the traps shrug back
and up, not forward toward the ears. Do not try to hold the position at
the top. For each rep, catch the bar in the finish position of the
deadlift and lower it back to the pins. Don’t let the bar fall from the
shrug back onto the pins without catching it at the hang; this is an
excellent way to hurt your back or hips very badly. Each rep starts at
and is returned to the pins; this requirement distinguishes a proper
barbell shrug from incorrect versions in which all reps start from the
hang and there is no explosive movement. The start from the pins, using
hip and leg drive to propel the bar up into the trap shrug, is what
allows the enormous weights to be used and causes it to be such an
effective exercise. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Heavy shrugs make the traps grow; there
is no doubt about it. At lighter weights, done with sets of five at the
1RM deadlift weight, they are good for cleans, and at heavier weights,
they prepare the traps for the top of the deadlift and prepare the brain
for the feel of very heavy weight. The heavier sets will always be done
with straps, due to the snap that </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">must be
present</span></span></span><span> at the top when the traps shrug the
bar. One work set after warm-ups is enough; sets across are extremely
stressful due to the heavy skeletal loading involved in supporting this
much weight, even for the brief time it takes to complete a rep.
Likewise, barbell shrugs should be used conservatively in the schedule,
maybe once every two weeks in the appropriately designed
program.</span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span><span class="calibre7"><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Notes about the power
rack</span></span></span></span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">. </span></span></span><span>The rack pull and the
barbell shrug obviously depend on the power rack, and its design is
critical for these and all the other exercises in this program that can
be done in one. A good rack should not be too expensive, and some of the
simplest designs are actually the best. The rack should have a floor –
it should not be merely </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">on</span></span></span><span> the floor, with you
standing on something that is not also holding the rack down. A heavy
plywood floor inside the rack and attached to the frame ensures that the
weight of you </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">and</span></span></span><span> the loaded bar is always
acting to stabilize the rack, so that when you set the bar back down on
the pins, the rack does not move. Your position between the uprights
will be determined by the depth of the rack (the distance between the
front and back uprights). </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Shallow racks are a pain in the ass, and
if the dimensions are wrong, the rack can be very hard to use. It should
be deep enough to squat inside of, with some play front to back not
being a problem. Drift during the set will occur no matter how careful
you are, and if the uprights are so close together that you keep bumping
them when you move a little, the quality of the set will suffer. If the
rack is too deep, the pins will have too much “bounce” because the long
span between front and back uprights requires longer, and therefore
springier, pins. Having the bar bouncing around on the pins is also
disruptive during the set. The rack pictured in <a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_011.html#filepos868352"
class="calibre9">Figure 7-2</a> is 22 inches deep. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>If the rack is not wide enough, it can
make loading the bar a problem. A narrow rack will allow an unevenly
loaded bar – which they all are while being loaded – to tip. This, and
the fact that a narrow rack is potentially very hard on the hands when
you’re racking the squat, makes 48–49 inches outside to outside a very
handy width for a power rack. The holes in the uprights should be on
3-inch centers or closer. This spacing allows for fine enough
adjustments in height that it is useful for all exercises inside the
rack, as well as for squatting and pressing outside the rack. (For more
details about racks, and the plans for building your own, see the
Equipment section of the Programming chapter.) </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Partial squats and
presses</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>These same principles – using different
versions of the parent exercise or portions of its range of motion as
assistance exercises, which we lump together under the term “partials” –
can be applied to squats and presses. Squats and presses, however,
respond differently due to the fundamentally different nature of the
exercises. The deadlift starts from the floor without a stretch reflex,
distinguishing it from a squat in more ways than just the location of
the bar. The hip and knee angles in the squat are already more acute
than at the start of the deadlift, and this longer range of motion is a
terribly critical distinction between the two, since the added ROM just
happens to be in the most mechanically disadvantageous part. The only
thing that mitigates this mechanically hard position is the
stretch-reflex rebound out of the bottom provided by the hamstrings,
glutes, and adductors. Squats that start from a dead stop, removing the
help provided by the stretch reflex, are quite useful when performed
from different positions: just below parallel, well below parallel, and
just above parallel. The pause makes the drive up very, very hard; a
below-parallel paused box squat done for five reps might be only 50–60%
of your 1RM. If you strengthen the squat at these positions from a dead
stop, the explosion you must generate to start up from the bottom
without the benefit of the bounce makes for a stronger squat when the
bounce is added back in.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="calibre7"><span><span class="calibre7"><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Paused squats.
</span></span></span></span><span>Paused squats can be done in two ways:
off a box or in the power rack. The box squat is an old training method
that has worked effectively for several generations of lifters. The box
is set up on the platform and behind the lifter, another step back from
the regular foot position for safety in backing up to the box. The box
can be an actual box, built of wood or metal, a plyometric jump box, or
a stack of bumper plates. The height should be variable, the box should
not slip against the platform or your butt, and it must be hell for
stout. The stance is generally the same as for the squat, perhaps a
little wider to allow the adductors to stretch a little more and
increase their contribution from the dead stop. </span></span></p>

Box squats done with stacked bumper plates. Use what you have, as long
as it is sturdy. </span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Take the bar out of the rack and step
carefully back to a position that allows a firm contact with the box as
your hips reach back at the bottom. This distance may vary with the box,
but in general your heels will be parallel to the front edge of the box;
if you are using stacked bumper plates, their radius will allow your
heels to be a little behind the front of the plates. The squat itself
will be an exaggeration of the correct form, with lots of attention paid
to getting the hips back, the knees out to the sides, and enough forward
lean to stay in balance with this extreme hips-back position. This
exaggeration is needed because you’re going to stop dead, with no
rebound, and then drive your hips up from the pause below parallel. The
difference in stance reflects the need to tighten up the bottom position
for an exaggerated hip drive without a rebound. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>As you approach the box, slow down so
that you don’t slap it with your butt. The purpose here is to load the
box carefully to avoid compressing your back. Pause for a second or two
and drive the hips straight up hard. Do not exhale at the bottom. Air is
support, and if ever in your life you need support, it will be at the
bottom of a box squat. This exercise can be used for varying numbers of
reps and sets, depending on the effect desired. The box can be varied in
height from several inches below parallel to an inch or two,
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">no
more</span></span></span><span>, above parallel. The deep versions use
lighter weights, as mentioned earlier, and the high-box version can be
done with weights greatly exceeding a 1RM squat. (This alone should
indicate how important it is to squat below parallel; high squats are
much easier to do with lots more weight because they are not a
full-range-of-motion exercise, and yes, a couple of inches does make
this much difference.)</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>A version of this exercise known as the
“rocking box squat” (developed at Westside Barbell in Culver City,
California, in the 1960s) has the weight leaving the feet briefly as you
rock back slightly and then coming back onto the feet before you drive
your hips up hard off the box. But keep this in mind: box squats are an
advanced exercise with a huge potential for injury if done by
inexperienced or physically unprepared trainees. The risk of spinal
compression between the box and the bar is very high, and high school
coaches </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">should</span></span></span><span> know better than to
allow it. Please do not do them if you are not prepared, and this
statement most definitely constitutes a disclaimer. </span></span></p>

</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span><span class="calibre7"><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Partial squats inside the rack.
</span></span></span></span><span>The other way to do partial squats is
inside the power rack with the pins set at a height that produces the
desired depth when the bar on your back touches the pins at the bottom.
There are, fascinatingly enough, two ways to do these. The easy way is
to set the pins at the desired depth, set up the hooks inside the rack,
take the bar out of the hooks, squat down to a dead stop on the pins,
and then come up. This method permits you to get tight and store some
elastic energy on the way down to the bottom even without a bounce,
preserving the effects of the eccentric and concentric order of things.
The hard way is to load the bar on the pins at the desired bottom
position, squat down under it and get in position to squat at the
bottom, and then squat the bar up from what is most assuredly a
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">very</span></span></span><span> dead stop. This method is
really a challenge at the lower reaches of depth and is hard with even
light weights. As with box squats, they get easy at rack heights much
above parallel, with so much quadriceps and so little posterior muscle
involved that they become good only for producing sore
knees.</span></span></p>
<br />

<br />

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure 7-5.</span></span></span><span>
Two ways to do squats in the rack. (A) The top start allows the
eccentric contraction to assist the concentric phase even in the absence
of a stretch reflex, and it can be used with much heavier weights. (B)
The bottom start, with the bar resting on the rack pins, requires that
the concentric contraction be started from a dead stop in the hardest
position of the movement, greatly increasing the difficulty and
decreasing the weight that can be used.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Bouncing the bar off of the pins
substitutes for the rebound that your hamstrings and adductors should be
providing, thus defeating the purpose of doing the exercise in the rack.
The bar should be lowered to the pins, fully stopped, and then driven
up. The dead stop from the pins provides the same opportunity to work
initial explosion out of the hole that box squats do, without the risk
of any spinal entrapment compression. It is easier to get tighter at the
bottom if you have had the whole trip down to the box or the pins to do
it; it is hard to get in an efficient position to squat if you have to
do it while wadded up at the bottom, unable to stretch down into the
bottom from the correct position assumed at the top. There are
advantages and disadvantages to each method, but by the time you’re
ready to do partial squats, you’ll have a feel for which one will work
best for you. Just remember: </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="bold">this type of squat training is not for novice
trainees.</span></span></span><span> </span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Notice that these options do not include
a half-squat, which would be done from approximately the hip and knee
angles seen at the start of the deadlift. The half-squat is an arbitrary
position to start or stop in since there is no anatomical reason to do
so. The full squat works because the hamstrings and adductors achieve
full stretch at this depth, but nothing good occurs at half-squat depth.
The positions from which the squat can be trained with useful assistance
exercises are all very close to the positions of the full range of
motion. Training from the bottom up to the middle and then going back
down is useful, as are all the variations that work up from the bottom
with a pause to kill the rebound. (The top half of the squat is very
easy if the bottom is strong, since the top half is the mechanically
easy part; conversely, training the top will not strengthen the bottom.)
But unlike splitting up the deadlift, it is not very productive to
divide the squat into an upper and a lower component and then train each
one separately. The top does not need the work, half-squats are hard on
the knees, and the bottom is the hard part of the squat, anyway; in
contrast, there is no easy part of a deadlift, and both halves of it can
successfully be worked separately.</span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span><span class="calibre7"><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Partial presses and bench presses.
</span></span></span></span><span>The press, like the deadlift, starts
from a dead stop, at least for the first rep of a set and for a 1RM.
Partial presses from different pin heights in the rack can be very
useful assistance exercises. Dead-stop explosion can be worked from
every position the rack permits to be set and loaded – from eyeball
level, to lockout, to overhead support work starting from locked-out
elbows. The bench press can be worked the same way as the squat inside
the rack, with the dead-stop assistance versions adding to the
effectiveness of the rebound when the regular bench movement is resumed.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>For presses, set the pins at the desired
position, from chin level (just off the shoulders) on up, even as high
as slightly below lockout, and press the bar off the pins with your
standard press grip, keeping the bar close to your face with good elbow
position and your chest up. Before it leaves the pins, tighten up
against the bar, taking all the slack out of your elbows and shoulders
before you try to make the bar move up. </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">Make sure you preserve the
critical movement of the torso under the bar.</span></span></span><span>
The higher the pins, the heavier the weight can be. The heavier the
weight, the greater the instability at the top, the harder it becomes to
prevent excessive layback, and the more stress the shoulders and abs
will receive. A belt is a very good idea here. </span></span></p>

</span></span></span><span>Pressing from different positions within the
range of motion inside the rack.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Resist the temptation to do lots of sets
with weights heavier than you can press, especially the first time you
try this. Pin positions in the middle of the movement – where most
people get stuck, the point at about the top of the forehead where the
transition from delts to triceps is trying to occur – are good places to
apply this kind of work. And as a general rule, any partial exercise is
quite useful when applied to the sticking points in its parent movement,
and most of the partial exercises were developed specifically for this
purpose. Reps can vary from sets of 3 to 10, but don’t get carried away
with the volume. Sets across from a dead stop will beat your shoulders
up, so pick a weight, do it for the number of reps you want to use, and
then adjust the weight in your next workout if you picked it wrong.
</span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The bench press can be used the same
way, with the bar loaded on pins set at the desired height above the
chest. Carefully center the flat bench so that it accommodates the
correct position under the bar, with your head on the bench and your
chest and elbows in the same place under the bar and in the same
position they would be in had you pressed the bar off your chest to this
level. As with the press, take all the slack out of your elbows and
shoulders before you push the bar up off the pins; this is important for
correct mechanical execution and to prevent excessive dynamic shock to
the tendon insertions on your humerus. Sets of five work well for both
presses and bench presses, but again, just use one heavy set. These are
very stressful, and you will develop pec insertion tendinitis if you do
too much work on partial exercises that allow the use of heavy weights.
Shoulders are easier to injure and more susceptible to overuse than
knees and hips are, and dead-stop exercises with heavy weights tend to
inflame the attachments pretty badly if they are used too often or at
excessive volume. But if you don’t get carried away by the glamour of
the heavier weights that are possible because of the shorter range of
motion, partial benches can make you very strong.</span></span></p>
<br />

<br />

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure 7-7.</span></span></span><span>
Rack bench presses allow for the use of heavier weights at different
heights above the chest. They must be respected for the amount of stress
they can produce if overused. </span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>You can also start either pressing
movement from the lockout position at the top by setting the hooks
inside the rack at this height, unracking the bar and then lowering it
to the pins, pausing, and driving back up, as with the rack squat. And
as with the squat, a bounce off the pins defeats the purpose of the
exercise; its value lies in the fact that it allows sticking points to
be worked from a dead stop. You must control the pause to prevent the
bar from getting out of position on the pins. This version of the press
is not commonly used, but it could be. More common is the
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">board
press</span></span></span><span>, which uses varying thicknesses of
lumber laid directly on the chest to make up the spacing for the
partial. It was developed to strengthen the top of the movement after
the use of the bench-press shirt (which helps the lifter get the bar off
the chest) became commonplace in competitions. The board press does not
require a power rack, but does require the assistance of a spotter for
the placement and removal of the board. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Many versions of all these exercises
have been developed by many people over the years and used with varying
degrees of success. The key is good form, an understanding of the
function and desired result of the exercise, and the judicious use of
loading.</span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>So it appears that for all the basic
exercises – the ones that normally use a stretch reflex as well as the
ones that start from a dead stop – partial movements from a dead stop
are useful. For the deadlift and the press, they mimic the mechanics of
the parent movement by training the dead-stop start from different
positions within the range of motion. For the squat and the touch-and-go
bench press, they make you generate all the upward motion without the
help from a stretch reflex. Either way, they are beneficial.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>But partial movements are not
substitutes for the parent exercises. The full movement is the primary
work, and the partial versions function as assistance work. If they were
capable of replacing their parent exercises, they would have already.
The full movement, by definition, involves muscles and neuromuscular
details that the partial movement does not; the partial movement is
therefore inferior to the whole parent exercise in its ability to
improve performance. Even the deadlift is better than its partial
derivatives; there are technical aspects to the deadlift that need to be
practiced, and only experienced lifters should substitute haltings and
rack pulls for the bigger, harder movement. For all these partial
exercises that allow the use of heavier weights or harder positions, the
point is to apply more or more-specific stress than the parent exercise
can produce. They must be used sparingly, under appropriate
circumstances, by trainees experienced enough to understand how and
why.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Squat
Variations</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>There are a couple of variations of the
basic barbell squat that should be discussed. Front squats and high-bar,
or Olympic, squats are commonly used assistance exercises. They are not
pieces of the back squat, but rather alternative versions of the parent
movement that can be used as a substitute if need be. Opinions differ,
and in the interest of full disclosure, they are described
here.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Olympic
squats</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The Olympic squat is preferred by many
coaches over the low-bar position described in this book. This could be
because it requires no coaching: the high-bar position, on top of the
traps, is what a trainee will self-select unless made to do otherwise,
and the knees-forward position at the bottom is what happens in the
absence of the intentional recruitment of the posterior chain. If you
tell a kid to “Go over to the rack and do some squats, I’m busy here
teaching the highly technical, and might I add more rewarding to coach,
snatch and clean and jerk” – in other words, if you have him squat
without teaching him how to do it – he will do a high-bar squat. Coaches
dealing with lots of trainees may prefer to just let them carry the bar
high, thus relegating the question of bar position to an insignificant
issue in the grand scheme of things. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The high-bar position is easier to get
in for people with inflexible shoulders, and some older trainees with
chronic shoulder problems have no choice but to squat this way; for
them, it is obviously better than not squatting at all. Shoulder
flexibility this bad sometimes improves, but sometimes, especially for
older trainees, it doesn’t improve much at all, especially if it is due
to bony changes within the joint capsule. We’ve already discussed the
reasons for preferring the low-bar position, so here we’ll assume that
the high-bar position is the alternate version and that there is a
compelling reason for using it.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span> The high-bar position requires that
more attention be paid to keeping the chest up, which depends on upper
back strength. The closer to vertical the back is, the smaller the
effects of the longer back segment. This more upright position is also
required if the squat is to stay in balance, since any squat is in
balance only when the bar is over the middle of the feet. But the more
upright the back and the more closed the knee angle, the less the
hamstrings are involved in the movement, since the hips are already
extended and the knees are more flexed. </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="bold">The farther forward the knees are,
the less involved the hips are.</span></span></span><span> All these
position requirements and leverage disadvantages make it necessary to
use lighter loads in the Olympic squat than in the low-bar version. If
you decide that the high-bar version might be useful, then use it as
your standard squat and focus on the upright chest position. Hip drive
will be greatly diminished, so it will not be useful as a cue.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Front
squats</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The front squat is a completely separate
exercise (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_011.html#filepos906373"
class="calibre9">Figure 7-8</a>), for a couple of very important
reasons. It varies enough from the squat that it should not be used by
novices still trying to learn that movement. The front squat uses a
different movement model than the squat, in that the hips are not the
emphasis when the lifter is thinking about how to do it – the knees and
the chest are the keys to the front squat.<br />
<br />
<span id="filepos906373"

class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure 7-8.</span></span></span><span>
Three views of the front squat. Note the very steep back angle and the
position of the bar over the mid-foot. </span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />
The differences in the two movements are entirely due to the bar
position (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_011.html#filepos908583"
class="calibre9">Figure 7-9</a>). Any squat that is in balance will keep
the bar over the mid-foot, while it is in the resting position at the
top and as it travels down and up through the whole range of motion of
the exercise. The low-bar squat will thus be done with a back angle of
somewhere between 30 and 50 degrees, depending on individual
anthropometry, to permit the bar’s vertical position over the feet. But
in the front squat, since the bar sits on the anterior deltoids, with
the elbows up and the hands trapping the bar in place, the back angle
must be nearly vertical to keep the bar over the mid-foot and prevent it
from falling off the shoulders. Front squats are missed when the weight
is too heavy to squat or too heavy for the back to stay upright enough
for the lifter to hold the bar in place. In either instance, the bar
falls away forward.
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>And since the back must stay nearly
vertical, the knees and hips must facilitate this: from the earliest
part of the movement in a front squat, the knees track forward (and out)
and the hips stay under the bar. This combination places the tibias in a
much more horizontal position than in a squat, and this position
significantly changes the mechanics around the knees and ankles, as well
as the hips and lower back.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure 7-9.</span></span></span><span>
The relationship between bar position for the two types of squats and
the resulting back, knee, and hip angles. </span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The position of the bar determines the
best way to drive up out of the bottom. The low-bar squat uses a
forceful, deliberate initial hip drive. The idea is to drive the butt
straight up out of the bottom, which more effectively makes the glutes,
hamstrings, and adductors contract. This hip drive is possible because
the bar is low enough to place the lifter’s back at an angle which
permits it; driving the butt up with the bar on the back just requires
that the chest be maintained in position, preserving the back angle.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Hip drive does not work for the front
squat. When the back is at a more horizontal angle, the hips present a
“surface” – the top of the glutes, the sacrum, and the lowest part of
the lower back – that a coach can touch with the hand and identify to
the trainee. The coach can place his hand on this area and tell the
trainee to “push it up,” a tactile cue that greatly improves the
efficiency of the contraction of the muscles that produce the movement.
The front squat has the hips directly under the bar, or as nearly so as
possible – a position which presents no surface for cueing. The column
of the torso stops at the chest and shoulders, and these, along with the
elbows, are the surfaces that get cued. A focus on the chest, shoulders,
and elbows – driving them up, even as you lower the bar – preserves the
vertical position that is so critical to finishing a heavy front squat.
This focus is in stark contrast to the squat’s, both in position and in
the way the movement is visualized. The differences are great enough
that they should not get confused, but they quite often do, and for this
reason the front squat is best left alone until the squat’s movement
pattern is thoroughly embedded.</span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Since the front squat has such radically
different form, you might expect that it should produce a different
result than the squat. It does, for the back, hips, and legs. The
vertical back position of the front squat seems like it would result in
a more direct compressional load on the spine than the squat’s more
horizontal angle would produce. This is partially true. The lower back
is in a nearly vertical position, but the upper back has a much tougher
job because the load it is holding up is farther away, forward. The bar
in a back squat, low-bar or high-bar, sits right on top of the muscles
that are holding it up. The front squat places the bar all the way
across the depth of the chest, which in a bigger guy might be 12 or more
inches. This distance is a moment arm that presents a mechanical
challenge to the muscles that maintain thoracic extension (it is very
common for lifters to get pretty sore between the shoulder blades when
first starting the exercise). And since the bar is forward of the hips,
too, there’s also a moment arm against the hips, although probably not
as long as in a squat, and certainly under a lighter load. So while the
lower back is vertically positioned, your thoracic erector muscles have
a lot of work to do. What actually happens is a gradual shift from
compression to moment, from low back to upper back, so things are not as
simple as they may seem. The load on the lumbar spine in the front squat
is friendlier (because it will be lighter) as long as the upper erectors
can maintain position, and for this reason, many people find front
squats to be easier on the low back. But this also means that the front
squat is a less effective back exercise than the
squat.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>When you front-squat, don’t worry about
your back; worry about your knees. To facilitate the vertical back, they
have to track forward so that the hips can stay directly under the bar.
This means that the shins will be much more horizontal at the bottom of
the front squat, with a closed knee angle, dorsiflexed ankles, and a lot
more moment force operating along the tibias than there is in a squat.
For most people, these factors will mean contact between calf muscles
and hamstrings at the bottom, and sometimes a rather dynamic loading of
the Achilles tendons and quadriceps. For some people, this closed knee
angle will create enough “wedging” on the posterior knee cartilage that
it can produce instability and injury, a situation that essentially
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">never</span></span></span><span> happens in a properly
performed low-bar squat. For everybody, the job of opening the knee
angle through a much greater ROM, with muscles working against more
moment force because of a more horizontal shin, is much harder.
</span></span></p>

<br />

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure
7-10.</span></span></span><span> The knee position in the front squat,
necessitated by the vertical back position, produces a moment arm along
the tibias, a phenomenon that is not significant in the squat.
(</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">M.A. = moment
arm</span></span></span><span>)</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Since the front squat places the knees
so much farther forward than they are at the bottom of the squat, the
hamstrings are not nearly as involved in the hip extension. In the front
squat, the vertical back and pelvic position and the acute angle of the
tibias place the hamstrings in a position where the origin and insertion
points are closer together, so the muscle bellies are shortened. If the
hamstrings are already contracted, they cannot contract much more and
thus cannot contribute much to hip extension. The hamstrings’ role in
the front squat is to maintain the vertical back angle, and their
already contracted position prevents them from contracting much further.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>But the hips must still extend, so the
glutes and adductors end up doing most of the job without the help of
the hamstrings. The knees-forward, vertical-back position puts the quads
in a position to do most of the work, since most of the angle to open
will be the knee angle. Three of the four quadriceps cross only the knee
joint, so any exercise that extends the knee will involve most of the
quads every time. The difference in the front squat is that very
noticeable glute soreness is usually the result the first few times you
do it. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>So the primary difference between the
squat and the front squat is one of degree in terms of the amount of
involvement from the contributing muscle groups. The knees-forward
position increases the moment force on the tibias, making the mechanics
of knee extension less efficient. At the same time, the contribution of
the hips is diminished by the vertical back position. The net effect is
that you cannot front-squat as much weight as you can squat in the
low-bar position. And the primary reason for the difference is the
position in which the system is in balance – the bar in both cases must
be over the middle of the foot, and the resulting correct back angle is
the one that keeps it there.</span></span></p>

<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Learning the front squat is best done
from the power rack or squat stand. The bar is set at the same position
as for a back squat, the level of the mid-sternum. The grip is a very
important component of the front squat, more so than in the back squat.
The grip must allow your elbows to come up high enough that your
shoulders can support the load while your back remains vertical during
the movement. The grip width will depend largely on individual
flexibility, and it will vary between trainees and during the individual
trainee’s career as flexibility is acquired through stretching or lost
due to injury. In general, the less flexibility a trainee exhibits, the
wider the grip will need to be. And some people have long forearms
relative to their humerus length and find it hard to elevate the elbows
with what would otherwise be a normal grip width. Adjust your grip width
as needed so that you can raise your elbows high enough to support the
bar. And if you cannot assume a position with at least some fingers on
the bar with the load on your deltoids after stretching and adequate
shoulder/elbow/wrist warm-up, you might not be able to front-squat
productively. </span></span></p>

<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Take the weight of the bar onto your
shoulders, with elbows in the elevated position, shoulders tight, and
chest up, before you unrack the bar. The weight sits on the meat of the
deltoids, and if your elbows are not in the up position before the
weight is unracked, they’ll never completely get there. Your chest must
also be up in a position that reinforces the shoulders, and you place it
there with the upper back muscles. Maintain this position by lifting
both your elbows and your chest as high as possible, from the time you
unrack the bar until you finish the last rep. To cue this movement,
think of touching a hand held above your sternum.</span></span></p>

<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Take the bar out of the rack and step
back a couple of steps to clear the hooks. (When the bar is loaded,
preferably with bumper plates, a miss will be dropped forward and no
spotters will be involved, so your distance from the rack must be
sufficient that the bar can fall without hitting anything but the
floor.) Your stance will be essentially the same as for the back squat:
heels at shoulder width and toes out at about 30 degrees. After assuming
the stance, lift your chest and elbows, take a big breath to support
this position, and squat. The vertical position of the back is retained
on the way down by forcing the knees forward and out, keeping the chest
and elbows up, and possibly even thinking about leaning back slightly.
The bottom of the front squat is quite easy to feel because some contact
between the calves and the hamstrings will occur. </span></span></p>

class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure

necessary, and this is one way to visualize the situation.
</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>There is no pause at the bottom, and the
ascent starts with an upward drive of the chest, not the elbows. Elbows
stay up, and the chest is driven up, since merely raising the elbows
will not positively affect the upper spine – the whole point of the
“chest up” cue. As the chest is driven up, the hips rise vertically
underneath it, maintaining the vertical position and keeping the bar on
the delts so that it doesn’t roll forward and down. The elbows-up
position traps the bar between the fingers and the neck, but the weight
is on the delts, not on the hands. At no time during the movement is the
back relaxed, at either the bottom or the top; the spine must be
consciously squeezed tight and held in position vertically, more of a
challenge in the front squat due to the bar’s position in front of the
neck and the consequently greater leverage against the upper back.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The differences in bar position and
hamstring function between the front and back squats necessitate a
different set of cues for each version. The back squat depends on hip
drive, and it is cued at the sacrum, as mentioned previously. The chest
and elbows are the focal points for attention in the front squat. “Big
air” is critical to chest position, as is the strength of the upper part
of the spinal erectors, which get sore when this position is trained
hard the first few times. Thinking about leaning back on the way down
may produce a feel for the position if it does not interfere with
balance; most people can grasp this concept without falling backwards.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Some people have proportions that make
the front squat difficult. A short torso with long legs is a bad
combination for good front squat form, and little can be done about
this. In extreme cases, it may be best not to perform the exercise if
correct form cannot be maintained due to an anthropometric problem that
cannot be solved (<a

class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure
7-15.</span></span></span><span> Anthropometry affects the lifter’s
ability to assume an efficient position in the front squat, as it does
with all barbell exercises. The front squat suffers from a short torso
and long legs. </span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Front squats are usually done in sets of
three, due to the greater sensitivity of the exercise to form
deterioration. Volume is accumulated with multiple sets
across.</span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Breath control is terribly critical in
the front squat. More leverage against the upper back – the result of
the increased distance of the bar from the spine – results in more
rotational force that must be countered. The support provided by
increased intrathoracic pressure is often the difference between holding
a heavy last rep in place and dropping it on the floor. A big breath
keeps the chest up, the shoulders up, and the elbows up by tightening
the entire upper body. You will need a new breath at the top of each
rep, maybe just a top-off of the previous breath so that you maintain
tightness. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>As mentioned previously, a missed front
squat will fall away forward off the shoulders. This is unavoidable
because if you are training hard, you will eventually miss a front
squat, so you might as well prepare for it by practicing it occasionally
during warm-ups. And unless you are used to getting away from the bar as
it falls – putting enough distance between you and the bar that it won’t
hit you on the way down – you might drop it on your knees or lower
thighs. This potentially painful error is usually prevented by most
people’s sense of self-preservation, but it is prudent to have at least
practiced missing the front squat a few times.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>One of the problems associated with
front squats is related to bar placement. If the throat is squeezed too
hard by a bar racked too far back on the shoulders, the result can be a
blackout. It is caused by the occlusion of the carotid arteries from the
pressure of the bar. This is dangerous because of the fall that will
occur if you allow yourself to pass completely out before doing
something about it (the blackout itself is harmless). If you feel your
perception start to change – and you’ll know it when it happens – either
rack the bar while you can, or drop it safely on the platform and take a
knee so that you don’t have as far to fall if the blackout continues to
develop. An uncontrolled blackout can cause severe head injuries if you
hit the racks, the bar, or the plates on the way down. To repeat: the
blackout itself is harmless and is corrected by moving the bar away from
the throat a little. Once the buzz diminishes, you can resume the set
with no trouble as long as you have made the correction. But if you
manage to black out once, you will find that you’re more prone to it for
the rest of that workout, so be careful when correcting the rack
position. </span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>One more thing: There is a version of
the front squat, referred to around here as the </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">California front
squat</span></span></span><span>, in which the lifter’s arms are crossed
in front, with the right hand on the left shoulder and vice versa. This
form involves less upper body flexibility than does the standard hand
position, and proportionately less security on the shoulders. It is not
as safe at heavy weights, and since we train with heavy weights, we
don’t use it. </span></span></p>

position is not advised. </span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The standard position is derived from
the clean, the movement typically preceding the front squat in Olympic
weightlifting, in which the bar is trapped against the shoulders by the
upraised elbows jamming the hands and the bar </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">back</span></span></span><span>
into the rack position. The crossed-arms position relies entirely on the
elbow position and completely loses the stability provided by the hands.
Doing front squats this way is tantamount to just holding your hands out
in front of you with the bar balanced on the delts. And if you need to
drop the bar in the event of a miss, the crossed-arms position makes the
drop awkward and hard to control. There is an argument to be made for
cleaning everything you’re going to front-squat, and California front
squats contribute to the argument. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Bench Press
Variations</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The bench press is such a popular
exercise that it’s no surprise there are lots of variations of the basic
version. Selectorized bench press machines that control the bar path
have long been a feature of multi-station machines; bars have been
developed that allow the weight to travel past the top of the chest,
down to where the elbows aren’t supposed to go; machines have been
invented that allow each side to work independently of the other (like
dumbbells, only much more expensive); the pec-deck takes the triceps out
of the exercise. None of these variations are particularly helpful
advances in exercise technology. The bench press is a valuable exercise
because it couples heavy potential load with the motor-control aspects
of barbell training, and these devices remove much of this benefit. The
most valuable variations preserve the benefits while allowing different
aspects of the movement that might need additional work to receive it.
They are of two types: variations in the grip width and variations in
the angle of the shoulder during the press.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Variations in grip
width</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The grip can be either wider or narrower
than standard. The narrower the grip, the more inclined toward the
middle the forearms are at the bottom, the sooner the elbows stop
traveling down as the bar touches the chest, and therefore the shorter
the range of motion around the shoulder, even though the bar travels
farther at the top. The less angle the humerus covers as it travels
down, the less work the chest muscles do; the more angle the elbows open
up, the more work the triceps do (<a

the close-grip and wide-grip bench presses. The distance the bar travels
is at maximum when the lifter’s arms are vertical in the lockout
position.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />
A medium grip – with the forearms vertical at the bottom – uses the
longest range of elbow motion, and a very wide grip involves a shorter
range of bar <span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">and</span></span></span><span> elbow motion because the
bar touches the chest before the elbows can travel down very far. With a
wide grip, the triceps extend the elbows over a shorter angle, and the
pecs and delts end up doing more of what work gets done. So, bar travel
is at maximum when the arms are vertical at lockout, and elbow travel is
at maximum when the forearms are vertical at the bottom. It is for this
reason that wide-grip benches have the reputation for being a chest
exercise. More weight can be benched due to the shorter range of motion,
and that is done without as much help from the triceps, so the chest
gets most of the work. </span><br />

bottom positions of the close-grip (A), standard-grip (B), and wide-grip
(C) bench presses. The deepest range of motion around the shoulder joint
occurs with the grip that allows the forearms to be vertical at the
bottom. Any other forearm alignment causes the bar to touch the chest
before the full range of motion is reached.</span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The close-grip version is not really
just a triceps exercise, though it seems to have that reputation. The
large elbow angle the triceps opens provides more stimulation for that
muscle group; the pecs and the delts are performing the same function –
adducting the humerus – but over a different range of motion, since the
humerus is more vertical at lockout but not as deep at the bottom with
the closer grip. Less weight can usually be done close-grip than with
the standard grip due to the decreased contribution of the pecs and
delts out of the bottom, but not much less. Compared with the wide grip,
the narrow grip is much harder in terms of total weight that can be
used, due to the range of motion and less pec and delt involvement,
while the wide-grip bench is a shorter movement that produces less work
and permits heavier weights to be used. It omits some of the triceps
work while relying much more on pecs and delts. The close-grip version
uses lots of triceps, uses the pecs and delts less, and is harder. If
your primary interest is in moving the heaviest weight, as a powerlifter
needs to do, the widest grip legal for the meet is the one to use. If
your interest is in the greatest amount of muscle stressed to cause an
adaptation, a medium grip is the most useful. And if you need to get
more triceps work, a close grip is useful for that.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The greatest effect comes from the
closest grip you can tolerate, and this will be controlled by your wrist
flexibility. On a standard power bar, the knurl has a gap of between 16
and 17 inches, so the edge of the knurl makes a good place to start.
After a bench press workout, take about 50% of your 1RM out of the rack
with a grip set so that your index fingers are on the lines formed by
the edges of the knurl. The exercise is performed the same way as the
standard bench press, with the same breathing, back setup, foot
position, and chest position. Rack the set, wait a little, and do
another set with the grip one finger-width narrower on each side.
Continue to narrow each set of five by one finger-width until your
wrists begin to complain at the bottom, and then widen back out by one
finger-width. You might have to widen your grip a little as the weight
goes up, because what doesn’t hurt with light weights may very well be
painful at heavier weights. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Close-grips are usually used at higher
reps, but this is merely tradition, and there is no reason that they
must be done this way. Since they use a lighter weight than the standard
bench press, they can be done after a bench workout, or they can be used
as a light-day exercise on a separate day. Care must be taken to hold
the bar very tightly; the wrist position makes for a less secure grip
than the conventional grip provides, and it has been known to fail on
the way up when the wrists twitch inconveniently. Close-grips are also
famous for reaching failure rather suddenly, with the last completed rep
giving little indication that the next one will get stuck on the way up.
As a general rule, exercises that depend on less muscle mass or fewer
muscle groups tend to fail more abruptly in their bar path than do
exercises that use more muscles. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Variations in
angle</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The other way to usefully vary the bench
press involves the angle at which the humerus approaches the chest,
controlled by the angle of the bench on which the exercise is performed.
The back angle thus determines the quality and quantity of pectoral and
deltoid involvement in the press. There are two variations from
horizontal: the decline, in which the shoulders are lower than the hips;
and the incline, in which the shoulders are higher than the
hips.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The decline press is a rather useless
exercise because the angle of the back in the decline position shortens
the distance the bar can travel, decreasing the amount of work done by
decreasing the range of motion. By decreasing the difficulty, the
decline press increases the weight that can be used in the exercise,
which in turn leads to inflated perceptions of one’s ability – it is
essentially masturbation, much like that which is possible with a
30-degree leg press or a half-squat. The decline press gets recommended
for its effects on the “lower pecs,” but dips perform this function much
more effectively, while involving more muscle mass, more balance and
coordination, and more nervous system activity, as discussed later.
Declines are dangerous because if their point of contact on the lower
sternum gets missed, the next stop is the throat. Couple this problem
with a heavy weight and a lousy spotter, and you might have a really,
really bad “chest” workout.</span></span></p>

the bench press and the decline bench press.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The incline bench press, however, can be
a useful variation. If you are doing both bench presses and presses,
then everything that the incline bench press accomplishes is redundant;
there is no aspect of shoulder and chest work that these two exercises
do not more than adequately cover. “Upper pecs” are quite thoroughly
involved in the press, and the bench press uses the whole muscle belly,
so there is no need to try to isolate this portion of the chest
musculature. But many sports involve the use of the arms at an angle
somewhere above 90 degrees from the torso, and some people believe that
this angle should be specifically targeted for resistance training. The
incline bench press does this, albeit at the cost of the body’s being
supported at this angle while the work is being done, something that
never occurs during the sports in question (see the discussion of this
in Chapter 3). </span></span></p>

collarbones meet the sternum. The bar will be very close to the chin on
the way down.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>But limitations are what make them
“assistance” exercises – if they were perfect, they’d be major exercises
and have their own chapters. The incline is useful in some cases, as
long as it’s done correctly; but it is easy to cheat, and pointless when
cheated. Most commonly, the effects of the angle of incline are negated
when the trainee raises his hips up off of the incline bench, thus
making his torso more horizontal. If a horizontal bench press is what
you want to do, just do the bench press. Indeed, this is a good reason
to just bench press and press. When doing inclines, people often allow
their greed to overwhelm their sense of honesty, and they try to lift
too much weight for the limitations of the inclined position, thereby
causing their hips to bridge just to get the last rep back in the rack.
The incline is an assistance exercise – don’t use so much weight that it
has to be cheated, because this defeats the purpose of doing it. Keep
your butt on the bench.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Most incline benches are made to be
adjustable so that the incline can be varied according to individual
preference. They are made with support uprights for the bar, like a
bench press bench, and the supports are also adjustable to enable the
bar to be unracked at a position that matches the angle of the bench.
(Fixed-position incline benches are available from some manufacturers,
with neither the angle nor the uprights adjustable.) The incline bench
also has a seat built into the frame so that trainees can maintain a
secure position without their feet becoming too critical to the lift. It
would actually be better if the feet were more involved, since this
would extend some, although not all, aspects of the kinetic chain down
to the floor. You occasionally find very old benches built this way,
with a foot plate at ninety degrees to the bench angle at the floor, but
they are not the industry standard now. </span></span></p>

bench.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>When doing the exercise, select a back
angle of between 30 and 45 degrees from vertical. Flatter angles are too
similar to the bench press, and steeper angles are too similar to the
press, with the disadvantage of having the back angle held immobile in a
position that is very hard on the shoulders. One reason the press might
be a better choice is that the stress of a tough rep can be accommodated
by the natural adjustment of the back position, whereas the incline
bench nails you into a fixed position that might exceed the capacity of
the fatigued shoulders.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The uprights should support the bar at a
height that allows the lifter to take it out, complete the reps, and
rack it with a minimum of elbow extension but no danger of missing the
racks. This means that the uprights should be set as high as possible so
that the lifter’s elbows are nearly straight, and so that when they are
straightened, the bar clears the hooks by a couple of inches. If the
supports are too low, too much work has to be done getting the bar out,
and more important, too much work will have to be done getting it back
in the rack at a time when lots of control might not be possible. The
easiest rack position will vary with your bench, and finding it will
involve some trial and error. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Most of the differences between the
incline and the bench press are positional. The two are basically
executed the same way. The chest is up, the back is tight, the drive is
to the point of focus on the ceiling, the feet are planted to connect
firmly with the floor, and “big air” supports the chest. The position of
the shoulders and back against the bench, the elbow position, the eye
gaze direction, breath control, grip, and foot position are all the same
for the incline as they are for the bench press, while the differences
are related to the angle. The shoulders are squeezed together for a
tight position, and the back is arched into a brace between the seat and
the point of contact on the shoulders. The elbows stay directly under
the bar for the whole movement; they control the bar path as they do for
a bench press. The eyes focus on the stationary reference of the
ceiling; they do not follow the bar. The breath is held during each rep,
with breathing occurring between reps at the top. The grip is the same
as that used for the bench, with the thumb around the bar, which rests
on the heel of the palm. The feet are firmly planted against the floor
as a brace for the position against the bench. The bar path will be
straight, but instead of touching the mid-sternum, the bar will touch
right under the chin, just below the sternoclavicular articulation (the
point where the collarbones and the sternum meet). The range of motion,
through an almost perfectly vertical bar path, is slightly longer than
for a flat bench press. The elbows’ position directly under the bar will
place the point of contact on the chest, at a place that is even with
the shoulder joints. The humeral angle – which does not approach 90
degrees of abduction – does not produce any shoulder impingement, as the
bench press does. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The starting position, at lockout over
the chest, will be the point where the bar is in balance directly above
the shoulder joints and where the locked-out arms are vertical, just as
in the bench press. But because of the angle, the distance between the
rack and the start position is much shorter for the incline, so the bar
is actually much easier to unrack and re-rack than it is for the bench
press. For this reason, the experienced lifter might find that a spotter
is less important for the incline, although this statement should not be
construed as permission to be stupid.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>If the incline is to be spotted, the
equipment must be compatible. Most good benches have a spotter platform
built into the frame. This allows the spotter to be sufficiently above
the lifter such that if a problem occurs, the spotter can safely pull
the bar up from a position of good leverage close to the bar. A spotter
standing on the floor cannot be depended on to help, and if heavy
weights are to be used, the equipment must allow for correct spotter
position. Likewise, if you feel as though two spotters are necessary for
the weight you’re doing, you should either use a lighter weight or do a
different exercise, because two spotters cannot safely spot an incline,
and heavy 1RM attempts on the incline bench press demonstrate a poor
understanding of the purpose of assistance exercises.</span></span></p>

Variations</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>We’ll discuss four main variations here:
the RDL, the SLDL, deadlifting from blocks, and the goodmorning (both
flat-backed and round-backed).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Romanian
deadlifts</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Once upon a time, as legend has it, the
incredible Romanian weightlifter Nicu Vlad visited the U.S. Olympic
Training Center. Vlad was strong, probably as strong as any human being
has ever been at a bodyweight of 220 pounds; word on the street has it
that he front-squatted 700 pounds for a double. So when Vlad performed
an exercise that no one had seen before, it quite naturally got a lot of
attention from people not as strong as he was. The exercise involved
taking the bar out of the rack from the hang position, stepping back to
clear the rack, and then lowering the bar down to the mid-shins and
raising it back to the hang position. This movement looked like a
deadlift, but one that started at the top instead of the bottom, so
naturally it had to have a new name. The term “Romanian deadlift” has
been applied to it since then, although its name translated from the
Romanian is probably something different (if it even has a Romanian
name; the exercise has been developed since that day entirely in the USA
and may simply have been Vlad’s way of dealing with unfamiliar
equipment). It is referred to by the initials “RDL.”</span></span></p>

legend has it, of the Romanian deadlift. Vlad was pretty damn strong.
</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The RDL has two important
characteristics that distinguish it from its parent exercise. The first
is that it uses very little quadriceps because the knees start off
nearly straight – unlocked, but not very – and pretty much stay that
way, so the quads don’t have an opportunity to actively extend the knees
during the movement. The RDL is specifically intended as a hip extension
exercise, and the quads are not supposed to be involved except to
isometrically anchor the knee angle from the anterior. All the work that
occurs through the bottom of the range of motion and that would normally
be shared between knee extensors and hip extensors is done only by the
glutes and the hamstrings. The lower back muscles keep the lumbar spine
locked in line with the pelvis. The hamstrings, acting at their
attachments on the ischial tuberosities, cause rotation around the hip
joints when they pull the bottom of the pelvis and the back of the knees
together, making the hamstrings and glutes the prime movers during the
exercise. </span></span></p>
<br />
<span class="calibre1"></span>
<p><span class="calibre7"><img src="./images/00558.jpg" class="calibre8"
alt="7-26.tif" /></span></p>
<br />

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure
7-24.</span></span></span><span> The function of the hamstrings in the
RDL is essentially all hip extension, both eccentric and concentric.
</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>But more important is the difference in
the fundamental nature of the two movements. The deadlift starts with a
concentric contraction as the bar is pulled from the floor, and the
eccentric phase is not really emphasized because the lift is essentially
over after it is locked out at the top. In contrast, the RDL is like the
squat in that the movement starts with an eccentric contraction, the
“negative,” which precedes the concentric. The bar starts from a
position of knee and hip extension, the bar is lowered down into
flexion, and a stretch reflex initiates the concentric contraction back
into extension. Any concentric contraction is stronger when it is
preceded by this stretch reflex, due to increased efficiency in motor
unit recruitment and to the ability of the elastic components of the
muscles and connective tissues to store elastic energy developed during
the eccentric lengthening of the muscle bellies. A jump is the best
example of this principle; every time a jump of any kind is performed,
it is preceded by a short drop of the hips and knees that creates a
stretch reflex in the muscles about to contract for the jump. It takes a
great effort of will to jump without this drop – it is such a normal
part of human movement that it is very difficult to exclude. The stretch
reflex also explains why bouncing the second through fifth reps of a set
of five deadlifts off the floor is so popular. The majority of weight
room exercises can be “cheated” with the use of a cleverly applied or
exaggerated stretch reflex. I myself have “curled” 205 in this
way.</span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>But for the RDL – and the squat, the
bench, the jerk, and maybe the press, depending on how it’s done – the
stretch reflex is not cheating but is an inherent part of the movement.
The bounce out of the bottom of the RDL enables rather heavy weights to
be used in the exercise despite the fact that the quads have been
excluded from helping with the movement. RDLs take advantage of the
stretch reflex just to the extent that it affects the hip
extensors.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The RDL starts in the rack with pins set
at a position a little lower than the level of the hands in the hang
position. This rack position allows for an easy, safe return to the rack
in the event of a slipping grip that might lower the bar before you rack
it. With a clean-width grip, take the bar out of the rack and step back
just far enough to clear the pins. Assume the same stance you use for a
deadlift, with heels 8–12 inches apart, toes pointed slightly out. Raise
your chest, and focus your eyes on a point on the floor about 10 feet in
front of you. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The whole point of the RDL is that the
back stays locked in extension while the hip extensors work. Unlock your
knees so that a little tension comes into the quads, but no more than
enough to lower the bar an inch or two down the thighs. Very little
knee-angle change should occur, although the knee position over the feet
will change slightly. This position will place your knees above a point
about halfway between the toes and the instep. Lift your chest up and
arch your low back into a tight lock, trying to maintain this position
for the whole movement. Start the bar down your thighs by shoving your
hips back, allowing your hips to come into flexion with the bar never
leaving the skin of the legs. At the same time, push your shoulders
forward, out in front of the bar, to the familiar pulling position. As
the bar approaches your knees, shove them back, too, shifting the shins
into a vertical position. Drop the bar down past your knees, keeping it
in close contact with the shins, and go </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">as low as possible without
unlocking your lower back</span></span></span><span>. Stop just before
your back begins to unlock – a position you will identify on the first
few reps – and start back up. The stretch at the bottom should help
change the direction of the bar without any pause. On the way up, keep
the bar in contact with your legs and keep your chest and back locked in
position. Breathe at the top, taking a big breath for every
rep.</span></span></p>

</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The emphasis on driving everything back
is very important; the use of the hips instead of the knees is what
engages the hip extensors and excludes the quads. It helps to think
about the weight shifting back to the heels, the knees moving back, the
bar being shoved back to stay in contact with the legs, and the butt
moving back; in fact, everything moves back except the shoulders, which
slide forward, out over the bar. The shins must come to vertical before
the bar reaches the knees, and the knees must never move forward at all
after the initial unlocking. Any forward knee movement puts the quads in
a position to contribute to the movement by extending the knees on the
way back up, canceling out the desired hip-extension effect.

class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure

the RDL. Note that the hip-angle change is predominantly responsible for
the ROM of the exercise. </span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The most common error will be the
knees-forward problem. You will be tempted to relax the tension on your
knees at the bottom; the hamstring tension builds all the way down and
is not relieved until the muscles are shortened, either by having done
the work of extending the hips at the top or by your relaxing your knees
forward at the bottom. If you shorten the hamstrings by allowing the
knees to drop forward – thus flexing the knees and causing the two ends
of the hamstrings to come together, taking the tension off from the
bottom – then the quads will do the work that the hamstrings should have
done when they extend the knees during the recovery to the top.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Remember from the discussion of pulling
mechanics in the Deadlift chapter that the shoulders stay in front of
the bar. This means that the arms are inclined back from the shoulders
at a slight angle, with the lats pulling back on the humerus to keep the
bar over the mid-foot. The lower the bar goes down your legs without
your knees bending, the more angle your arms must assume to keep the bar
over the mid-foot, and the more work the lats must do to maintain this
position. At a very low position on the shins, this angle becomes quite
extreme, contributing to the difficulty involved in doing a strict RDL
very far below the knees. In fact, if you touch the floor at the bottom
of an RDL, you are probably doing it with a fairly light
weight.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Also common is the failure to hold the
back rigid in absolute extension. One of the main benefits of the RDL is
the isometric work it provides for the erectors, as they hold the spine
rigid while the hamstrings extend the hips. This back position is rather
hard to hold, and the lifter needs a lot of concentration to keep the
chest up and the low back arched with no looseness, while sliding the
hips back, the knees back, the bar back, the heels down, and the
shoulders forward. For a slow exercise, the RDL is technically difficult
because it is very easy to do wrong. If the back rounds or the knees
come forward, less work is being done by the targeted muscle groups and
the movement feels easier. But done correctly, with the back locked into
rigid extension and no knee extension involved, the RDL is perhaps the
best assistance exercise for deadlifts and cleans because it works the
very things that cause heavy deadlifts to be missed. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The best cues for good form on the RDL
are “chest up,” “arch the back,” and “knees back,” with an occasional
reminder to keep the weight off the toes. The chest cue will remind you
to keep the thoracic spine in extension, while arching the back usually
gets interpreted by most people as a low-back cue. The knee cue keeps
the quads out of the movement, but it can also cause the bar to fall
away from the legs, and you might need to cue the lats by thinking “push
the bar back.” </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>When you’re doing heavy RDLs, use a
double-overhand grip. The shoulder asymmetry that results from an
alternate grip is not desirable for this exercise, and the lats cannot
effectively pull the bar back into the legs if you are using a supine
hand on one side. The weights that will be used for heavy RDLs are not
really heavy relative to the deadlift, with most people being able to
use between 65% and 75% of their 1RM deadlift for the exercise, so using
a plain old double-overhand grip will not usually be a problem. Use a
hook grip or straps if your grip strength is insufficient, which it
should not be at 65–75% of 1RM, but both your hands must be in the prone
position. Being an assistance exercise, RDLs are done in the range of
5–10 reps. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Stiff-legged
deadlifts</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The stiff-legged deadlift (or SLDL) is
possibly a more familiar exercise in most gyms, as a result of the fact
that many people do the deadlift wrong and it ends up looking this way
accidentally. The SLDL is essentially an RDL off of the floor – without
the stretch reflex but with the higher hips, more horizontal back angle,
and more vertical shins of the RDL. Since the SLDL starts on the floor,
it involves a longer range of motion than does the RDL, which is
supposed to stop at the point where the low back unlocks due to
limitations in hamstring extensibility. Most people can’t do a strict
RDL all the way down to the floor with the bar loaded with 17-inch
plates, so you will have to do the SLDL with enough knee bend to allow
your back to get into a good position to start. The amount of knee bend
will obviously depend on individual flexibility. The point of the
exercise is stiff legs – knees extended as much as possible and hips
higher than in a deadlift, with the low back flat in the start position
– so use as little knee bend as possible. </span></span></p>

<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Take your regular deadlift stance, with
the bar directly over the mid-foot. Use the regular double-overhand
clean grip, for the same reasons mentioned above for the RDL. Unlock
your knees and set them in position hard, as straight as your
flexibility permits. Raise your chest, take a big breath, and pull. The
SLDL is essentially a deadlift done according to the five steps <a
href="#filepos405746"
class="calibre9">outlined previously</a>, but without Step 3, the
dropping-the-shins-forward-to-the-bar part. This means that the bar
leaves the floor from over the mid-foot but is still in the air while in
front of the shins. When the bar is just above your knees, it comes onto
your legs, and the pull is then locked out like a regular deadlift at
the top. Again, each rep is replaced on the floor, reset, and pulled
from a stop; it is a deadlift, not an RDL, and </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">each rep starts from a dead
stop</span></span></span><span>. </span></span></p>

</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Both SLDLs and RDLs are versatile
exercises and can be applied to your training in many ways. They can be
done in a variety of rep ranges, depending upon the desired effect. When
they’re used as a substitute for the deadlift on a light day, sets of
five work well; in fact, SLDLs and RDLs can be used for sets across,
unlike the deadlift, since they do not produce the stress that the full
heavy movement is known for. For back-off work following deadlifts, they
can be used for sets of 8–10 reps to accumulate extra volume. And
high-rep sets of 20 RDLs can be an interesting addition to your
training. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Despite the fact that both the RDL and
the SLDL can produce extreme hamstring soreness in the short term that
can interfere with the normal range of motion of the knees, both
exercises provide an excellent way to increase the extensibility of the
hamstrings over time. They are excellent stretches and are often used
with light weights as warm-ups for the deadlift and the
squat.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Deadlifting from
blocks</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Another variation on the deadlift is to
do the exercise while standing on blocks. By adding their height to the
range of motion, the blocks increase the amount of work done (you can
get the same effect by using plates with a smaller than 17-inch
diameter). The blocks also add more knee extension – and therefore more
quadriceps – to the exercise. Because the bar is farther away from
lockout, the lifter needs more knee and hip flexion to assume the start
position at the bottom, and the more acute angles require more hamstring
extensibility for the lifter to assume the start position with an
extended lumbar spine. These requirements make it more difficult for
inflexible people to get in a correct start position, so not everybody
can do this exercise. Be aware that for obvious reasons, a deadlift on
blocks is an even more stressful movement than the full deadlift, so
treat it with respect. No sets across with max weights, because
deadlifts on blocks are an assistance exercise; use them at sub-max
loads to accumulate work and to make the deadlift easier off the floor.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre5"><span
class="bold"><span>Goodmornings</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The goodmorning is sometimes thought of
as a squat variation since the bar is taken out of the rack, as in a
squat, and carried on the traps. But since the goodmorning functions as
a back and hamstring exercise, with no more knee extension than an RDL,
and with lots of elements of pulling mechanics in the movement of the
bar, a case can be made for considering it a deadlift variation.
Goodmornings get their name from the rather tenuous similarity between
their appearance and that of a subordinate individual greeting his
superiors in the a.m. They are an old weight room exercise, largely
unused today, but they are worthy of consideration as a way to
strengthen your pull. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>In a goodmorning, the bar sits on top of
the traps, as it does in a high-bar squat. Basically, you perform a
goodmorning by bending over with the bar on your neck until your torso
gets to parallel with the ground or lower and then returning to an
upright position. The movement is similar to that of the Romanian
deadlift in that the whole thing is essentially a hip extension that
begins with an eccentric contraction – think of it as an RDL with the
bar on your neck. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>In the RDL, as with a pull, the bar
stays over the middle of the foot, with a vertical bar path; in the
goodmorning, the bar makes an arc as it is lowered. The arc occurs
because the distance from the bar to the hips along the back is usually
longer than the distance from the hips to the unlocked knees, and when
the bar is lowered, it travels forward (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_011.html#filepos978275"
class="calibre9">Figure 7-29</a>). This arc produces the intentional
departure of the bar from a position of balance above the mid-foot, thus
creating a moment arm between the bar and the balance point and using
that as an aspect of the resistance in the exercise, as a heavy barbell
curl does. As the weight gets heavier – and as the resulting center of
mass of the lifter/barbell system gets closer to the bar – the bar path
moves closer to the mid-foot. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>There are two ways to do goodmornings:
flat-backed and round-backed. The flat-backed goodmorning places the
hips a little farther back at the bottom of the movement than they are
at the bottom of the RDL (since the bar is on top of the traps instead
of hanging below the scapulas), even though the bar is in front of the
toes. The round-backed version allows both the bar and the hips to stay
closer to the mid-foot balance point. The difference is in the effective
length of the back – the flexed spine is effectively “shorter” than the
spine in rigid extension – and thus the two movements differ in the
length of the moment arm they create between bar and
hips.</span></span></p>

</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Flat-backed goodmornings are the most
like the RDL. The knees are unlocked, the chest is up, the low back is
arched, and the bar is on the traps, with the hands pulling it down into
the neck to keep it from rolling or sliding up at the bottom. (It is
important to stabilize the bar against your neck and keep it from
sliding, especially when you’re using a bar with a center knurl; it will
most assuredly dig a ditch in your neck if it moves.) The movement
basically consists of sliding your hips back to lower the bar down as
far as hamstring flexibility permits before your low back rounds. The
idea is to keep the back in extension the whole trip down and up, and
the parallels to the RDL should be clear. Your flexibility will
determine your depth, and the goodmorning improves hamstring length;
there is not a much better stretch than a strict flat-backed
goodmorning. </span></span></p>

goodmorning. </span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The round-backed goodmorning is a
completely different exercise. We have many times described the
efficient and safe back position as “normal anatomical position” –
thoracic and lumbar extension. This position is the best way to load the
intervertebral discs and the most efficient way for force to be
transmitted along the torso. But there are many situations, either at
work or in many sports, where lifting must take place under
circumstances that prevent an ideal extended-spine position, and it
makes sense for post-novice lifters to train for this eventuality.
Strongman competitions, for example, involve stone lifting, where a
large stone that cannot be placed in a position that allows the
competitor’s spine to be extended must be lifted off the ground to an
upright position. The trip from the ground to hip and knee lockout has
to be done with the back in flexion. Or a situation may arise “in the
field” that requires you to lift an object – perhaps a fellow soldier in
85 pounds of kit – whose shape has no respect for your finely developed
sense of correct kinematics. </span></span></p>
<br />

7-31.</span></span></span><span> Round-backed lifting trains the back
for situations where perfect lifting mechanics are not possible. Stone
lifting is a good example of this. </span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>If spinal flexion is the position that
must be used, the big held breath is the mechanism that must stabilize
it. The intervertebral discs are best positioned to bear a compressive
load when they conform to their normal resting geometry. But lifting a
load from the ground is not primarily compressive until the final stages
of the pull, when the back becomes erect. Moment forces with a
rotational or shear component are the primary stresses on the back as
the load comes off the ground. If the spine is in flexion and its
rigidity in flexion can be maintained, the submaximal loads normally
encountered in a field situation can be safely handled, especially by a
strong lifter used to handling much heavier weights. The same Valsalva
maneuver used in all barbell exercises provides stability and protection
for the spine in the less-than-optimal positions often encountered
outside the gym. </span></span></p>
<br />
<span class="calibre1"></span>
<p><span class="calibre7"><img src="./images/00590.jpg" class="calibre8"
alt="7-Lawnmower.tif" /></span></p>
<br />

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure
7-32.</span></span></span><span> Handling an awkward object will not be
so much a matter of the heavy weight, because heavy weights cannot be
handled from a position of bad mechanics. The issue will be spinal
stability in the awkward position. For a flexed spinal position where
the mechanics cannot be improved, the best protection for the spine is a
solid Valsalva maneuver. </span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Some round-backed lifting prepares you
for this inevitable situation, and when planned and executed on your
terms instead of the universe’s, it can be made a productive adjunct to
normal pulling and back work. The round-backed goodmorning deliberately
employs less-than-optimum spinal mechanics in order to strengthen the
back against the inevitable occurrence of bad mechanics during a
fatigued deadlift attempt or a normal day at work. It is a relatively
safe way to introduce this position in the context of a controllable,
increasable barbell exercise. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Round-backed goodmornings are probably
better than round-backed deadlifts because of the tendency to use
lighter, safer weights for them and because of the lack of interference
with the correct movement pattern in a lift that is already prone to
errors. But since round-backed movements would have to be considered
advanced exercises, and therefore not really indicated for inexperienced
lifters, the advantages of round-backed goodmornings over round-backed
deadlifts are not really germane; advanced lifters should have no
trouble separating two styles of deadlifting from each other. The
important points are that round-backed lifting is not always bad,
because it is inevitable, and that goodmornings done this way are a good
introduction to this aspect of conditioning for sports and for
life.</span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Take the bar out of the rack as you
would for a flat-backed goodmorning, take a big breath, and start down
by dropping your hips back. Immediately drop your chest, rolling it down
toward your knees. It is usually possible to go lower than the
flat-backed form permits, since adequate hamstring flexibility to
maintain lumbar extension is not the limiting factor in this version.
Maintain the flexed back position all the way down and back up, using
your air to support the curve. Come back up by first lifting your back
and then shoving your hips forward, and finally by raising your chest to
coincide with the return to the starting position. As with flat-backed
GMs, higher-rep sets of 8 to 10 work well. Round-backed goodmornings are
an optional, advanced exercise. No one’s feelings will be hurt if you
don’t do them at all, but if you use them, do them right, and light.

</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The goodmorning allows for more direct
stress on the hip extensors. But you must remember that this weight is
sitting </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">on
your neck</span></span></span><span>. Any work done by the hip extensors
must be transmitted along the spine, and the leverage against the
smaller cervical and upper thoracic vertebrae will be very high. Be
careful about using lots of weight and generating high velocities; the
goodmorning is an assistance exercise, not a primary lift, and it must
be respected for both its usefulness and its potential for injury. The
smartest of the strongest men in the world never use more than 225
pounds for the goodmorning, and since it is an assistance exercise, they
use sets of 8 to 10 reps. Done correctly, goodmornings make the back
stronger; done incorrectly, they can make the back injured. Use good
judgment when deciding how much weight to use. There will never be a
reason to use more than 35% of your squat for sets of 8–10, and there is
no reason to do them at all until 35% of your squat is 95 pounds.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Press
Variations</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Two main variations here: the
behind-the-neck press and the push press.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Behind-the-neck
presses</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The first thing that usually comes to
mind when people think of different ways to press overhead is the
behind-the-neck version, along with its close relative, the Bradford
Press, which involves changing the bar position from front to back
during the press. When the bar is behind the neck, the shoulders are put
in a position that is not particularly advantageous under a heavy load.
This position is right at the edge of the shoulder’s range of motion and
puts a lot of stress on the ligaments that hold the shoulder together.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The shoulder (or glenohumeral) joint is
formed by the articulation of three bones: the clavicle or “collarbone,”
the scapula, and the humerus. The head of the humerus is the ball, and
the </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">glenoid
fossa</span></span></span><span> of the scapula is the socket of this
ball-and-socket joint. The glenoid is a rather stingy little cup, not a
nice deep socket like the acetabulum of the pelvis, and it depends much
more on ligamentous and tendinous support for its integrity than the hip
does. The net effect of this arrangement is a joint that is less stable
at the edge of its range of motion than might be desired. The
behind-the-neck press places the humeral head in just about the worst
position it can assume under a load. If this exercise is to be used in a
program safely, it has to be done with such light weights that it
becomes almost a waste of time if strength is the goal. It has been done
with heavy weight by big strong men, but none of them got that way with
this exercise.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Push
presses</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>A better exercise is the push press. It
is more than just cheating the press with your legs. The push press uses
momentum generated by the hips and knees to start the bar up, and then
uses the shoulders and triceps to go to lockout, as in a normal press.
The movement begins with a stretch reflex, where the knees and hips
unlock, you drop down a little, and then you drive back up – the
extensors lengthen a little and then immediately contract forcefully
into lockout. This sharp extension provides enough drive to get the bar
off the shoulders and started on its way up. It is not really a “push”
so much as it is a bounce, since the knees and hips do not unlock and
then stop in the unlocked position. It is exactly as though you are
trying to bounce the bar up off of your shoulders by using your hips and
legs.</span></span></p>
<br />
<span class="calibre1"></span>

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure
7-34.</span></span></span><span> The push
press.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>This bounce requires that the bar be
resting on the meat of the deltoids when this upward force gets there.
If the bar is being held in the hands – resting on the palms or fingers
instead of seated firmly on the shoulders – then the force of the bounce
gets absorbed in the elbows and wrists instead of being transmitted to
the bar. This may mean that the grip for a push press is a power-clean
grip, wider than you use for a press, since longer forearms make the bar
harder to set on the delts with a standard press grip. The solid
connection between the bar and the shoulders allows the full effects of
the hip and leg drive to carry the bar on up. A full breath before each
rep braces the torso and makes the push more solid. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>More weight can be lifted with a push
press than with our press technique in chapter three, and certainly more
than with a strict press, and for this reason, a heavy set of presses
might get finished with a push press or two. A better approach is to
keep the two exercises as separate as possible in your mind, choosing
your work weights carefully enough that a set of five presses does not
turn into a set of two presses and a triple push press. After finishing
your last set of presses, you might add extra work in the form of two
heavier sets of push presses. Or better yet, you could use push presses
as a completely separate exercise on a different day, either after bench
presses or as their own primary upper-body exercise. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>In addition to the same problems that
affect the press, the push press has its own problems that derive from
the involvement of the knees and hips. The most common error is the
tendency to dip forward onto the toes during the push. The bounce must
come from the whole foot, not from the toes, or the lifter/barbell
system gets displaced forward. If the dip has a forward component, the
motion of down-and-forward turns into up-and-forward, instead of
straight down and straight up. You will then have to “chase” the bar as
it goes forward on the way up, diluting your shoulder drive.<br />
<br />
<span class="calibre1"></span> </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><img src="./images/00607.jpg" class="calibre8"
alt="120-DSC_2649.tif" /> <img src="./images/00608.jpg" class="calibre8"
alt="120-DSC_2651.tif" /></span></p>
<br />

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure
7-35.</span></span></span><span> The tendency to dip to the toes instead
of staying flat-footed introduces a forward component into the upward
motion. You can control this motion by thinking about keeping the weight
on your heels during the dip. A balanced dip distributes the stress
evenly between the hips and the knees. </span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />
Correct this error by making sure your dip is to your mid-foot, and if
you are dipping forward, the easiest way to ensure a straight dip is to
raise your big toes inside your shoes before each rep. Your weight will
shift back toward your heels, and once you get used to the way this
feels, the problem will stop without your having to cue the big toes for
each rep. This is a handy trick to learn, especially if you have
entertained the possibility of any Olympic weightlifting; the dip that
precedes the split jerk is essentially the same as the push-press dip,
and if you correct it now, it will not be a problem later.
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Push presses can be hard on the knees,
believe it or not. The knee extensor tendons are subjected to some
rather high forces during heavy push presses, and this is especially
true if you are dipping to your toes. Stay out of your knees as much as
possible to minimize the abuse. Knee wraps may help, but good form helps
the most.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span> Just so you won’t think they’ve been
forgotten, assistance exercises for the power clean fall squarely in the
bailiwick of Olympic weightlifting and are outside the scope of this
book. Those of you who are interested are encouraged to contact a
competent weightlifting coach and develop a relationship with the sport.
There is no better way to use barbells to train for power
production.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Ancillary
Exercises</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Not every assistance exercise
necessarily duplicates a portion of a parent movement. There is no
chin-up-like motion in any of the five major lifts, yet chins are a
terribly useful exercise for lifters at all stages of training
advancement. Chin-ups are multi-joint, they involve the movement of the
whole body, they work many muscle groups, and they depend on a complete
range of motion and correct execution for their quality – all
characteristics of the major exercises. In contrast, it is difficult to
do a wrist curl wrong, and really, who cares if you do? Good ancillary
exercises contribute to functional movement the same way the major lifts
do: they work several joints at one time through a range of motion that,
when made stronger, contributes to performance in sports and
work.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Ancillary exercises have traditionally
been performed for higher reps than the core lifts are. This is not
necessarily a hard-and-fast rule; some of these movements are very
valuable as strength exercises in and of themselves. Some lend
themselves better to this than others: weighted chin-ups and dips are
quite useful at lower reps and heavy weights, whereas heavy weighted
back extensions can be rather hard on the knees. Each exercise has its
own specific applications and fits into each individual trainee’s
program in different ways.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Chin-ups and
pull-ups</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Possibly the oldest resistance exercise
known to the human race is the pull-up. Arboreal primates use this
movement in the process of locomotion, and ever since we’ve been
standing on the ground, it’s been difficult to resist the temptation of
grabbing a branch overhead and putting our chins up over it. And you
should be strong enough to do that; the pull-up is not only a good
exercise but also a very good indicator of upper-body strength. If you
can’t do very many chin-ups, your press and bench press will increase as
you get stronger on this very important exercise. And that is why it is
the only ancillary exercise included in the novice
program.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Chin-ups and pull-ups are most famous
for their effects on the latissimus dorsi muscles (the “lats”), but they
are equally important for the other muscles of the upper back – the
rhomboidius, the teres major, the serratus groups, and the rotator cuff
muscles, as well as the forearms and hands. Chin-ups even work the pecs
a little, if done from a diligent dead hang, and abs, if enough reps are
used to get them fatigued.</span></span></p>

and the pull-up (</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">bottom pair</span></span></span><span> B), done in the
power rack, uses a prone grip. </span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>In this book, the term “pull-up” refers
to the version of the exercise with the hands prone, while “chin-up” or
just “chin” refers to the version done with supine hands. The major and
significant difference between the two is the biceps’ involvement in the
chin-up and the lack of it in the pull-up. The addition of the biceps
makes chin-ups a little easier than pull-ups, as well as adding the
aesthetic elements of arm work to the movement. Pull-ups are harder, and
they probably emphasize lat involvement more since the absence of the
biceps means that something else must do its work. Because of the
pronation, pull-ups also might aggravate the elbows for a lifter who is
not very flexible. The prone grip shortens the distance between grip and
shoulders; the supine grip tends to increase this distance if you don’t
pay attention to keeping it close (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_011.html#filepos1003969"
class="calibre9">Figure 7-37, B</a>). So the pull-up might seem easier
for some people if they stay too far away from the bar on chin-ups. Once
your strength permits, you can add weights to strict chins and pull-ups
for increased workloads. The more your trunk moves, the more trunk
muscles are involved, and this is why abs can get sore. But any version
of the chin-up or pull-up, where the whole body moves, is better than
the machine version of the exercise, the “lat pulldown,” in which only
the arms move. </span></span></p>

elbows and ends with the chin well over the bar, as high as possible. An
incorrect chin-up displays an incomplete range of motion, starting with
bent arms <span class="italic">(left)</span> or ending under the bar
<span class="italic">(right)</span>. </span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Chin-ups are a better introductory
exercise than pull-ups, and perhaps a better exercise altogether because
they involve more muscle mass. We’ll use a bar set at slightly above the
level of the up-reached fingertips while we’re standing flat on the
floor. When you are hanging from this level, your toes should just touch
the floor. This is, of course, an ideal height, and your equipment may
be lower or higher. The crossbar at the top of a power rack works well,
as might a bar set high in the rack pins. If you are fortunate enough to
train in a gym enlightened enough to have provided chin bars, enjoy
them, for they are not common. A bar that is 1¼ inches in diameter feels
the best in most hands, unless they are unusually small. But it is not
hard to make do, and most training facilities will have a place for the
innovative trainee to chin. </span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>In the chin-up grip, your palms are
facing you, about shoulder width apart. Grip width can vary several
inches depending on elbow flexibility; the more easily the hands can
supinate, the wider the grip can be. The wider grip increases supination
and biceps involvement. The wider the grip is, the greater the external
rotation of the humerus is. The closer the grip is, the more internally
rotated the humerus, the more abducted the scapulas, and the less
involved the scapula retractors and posterior delts are. Grip width may
not be a practical variable to manipulate due to the joint stress it
causes at the extremes of wide and narrow, but since grip width affects
the way the shoulders interact with the load, some shoulder injuries can
be affected by grip width. A shoulder-width grip is good for our
purposes and presents no problems for most people. Chalk makes for a
better grip and fewer calluses, and using it is a necessary. A knurled
or rough bar destroys the hands and therefore adversely affects the rest
of your training. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The movement itself is obviously simple:
take your grip, and pull your elbows “down,” which results in your
leaving the ground. Each rep starts from a full stretch at the bottom,
with elbows straight and scapulas stretched up, and is complete when
your chin clears the bar. A more honest approach might be to touch your
chest to the bar, but we’ll count the rep if your chin clears the bar
with your face forward, and your head not back. Try to stay as close to
the bar as possible. The Gold Standard rep is done from a dead hang,
with a slight pause at the fully stretched-out bottom. It is terribly
common to see partial chins, which should be called “foreheads” or
“nose-ups” and are usually accompanied by less-than-straight elbows at
the bottom. For a high-rep set, you can use a stretch reflex at the
bottom as long as the bottom is actually The Bottom. In this case,
breathing will consist of a </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">quick</span></span></span><span> breath at the top of
each rep. For a higher-rep set to failure (maybe 12 or more reps),
you’ll find that the first two-thirds to three-fourths of the set will
be rebounded, and the last reps will be done from a dead hang as you
take a couple of breaths between reps at the bottom. The same rules
apply to pull-ups, if you decide to do them. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Cutting the rep short at either the top
or the bottom is as bad as squatting high: the primary benefit of the
exercise lies at the ends of the movement. The bottom stretches out the
lats, and the first shrug of the stretched-up scapulas down is all lats
and upper back muscles. The finish at the top is biceps and triceps, and
a completed rep means you have moved your body a constant, measurable
distance through space. Each rep is therefore the same, and your effort
becomes quantifiable, not just a flailing-around in the
air.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>But what if you can’t do a complete
chin-up? Lower the bar a little (or raise the floor, possibly an easier
thing to do, artificially) and use a jump to get the movement started
until you’re strong enough to do it strict (<a

<br />
Be sure to lower yourself under control to get the most out of the
negative, and always use <span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">only</span></span></span><span> as much jump as
necessary. Or you can use resistance bands in the rack until you are
strong enough to do the movement with only a jump. The ability to do an
honest chin-up may be beyond some novices at a heavier bodyweight, and
if you cannot do a good strict rep at all, it will be best to wait until
your lats and arms are stronger from deadlifts and presses or until your
bodyfat comes down enough to permit you to handle your bodyweight
effectively on the bar.</span>

<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Kipping chin-ups and pull-ups are
gymnastic derivatives of the jumping version. The kipping version uses
the momentum of a slight swing preceding the pull, when the swing is
converted into an upward roll of the hips, translating the swing energy
into upward movement. The kip distributes the movement over more muscle
mass, using the abs, hip flexors, and lower back in addition to the lats
and arms, so that more muscle mass is used in the exercise and more reps
can be done. Strict chins and pull-ups concentrate the effort on less
muscle mass and work it harder. </span></span></p>

<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Kipping chin-ups and pull-ups have
proven themselves to be useless as a way to strengthen the strict
versions of the movement, and in the absence of enough strength to do
the strict versions, they have proven to be dangerous for shoulder
health. Resist the temptation to jump on any bandwagon that encourages
short-term gratification at the expense of long-term progress. Many
people who can do 15 kipping reps cannot do 2 dead-hangs, and have made
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">no
progress</span></span></span><span> on their dead-hangs since they
started cheating the movement with the kip. If you want to use kipping
pull-ups or chin-ups in a conditioning workout, make sure your shoulders
and arms are strong enough to do 8–10 strict reps first so that you
don’t hurt yourself chasing a meaningless number. If you cut this
important corner, shoulder surgery may be the only reward you
receive.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Weighted chins and pull-ups are an
excellent source of heavy non-pressing work for the upper body. Plates
are suspended from a chain on a belt, or a dumbbell can be held in the
feet if not much weight is used. A good rule of thumb is that when you
can do 12–15 bodyweight reps, it is probably time to start doing some of
the work weighted, possibly alternating higher-rep bodyweight workouts
with lower-rep weighted workouts. Several sets across are appropriate
for chins and pull-ups, either weighted, unweighted, or assisted. And
many people have made steady linear progress by microloading their chins
the same way they program the bench press and press, adding 1.5–2 pounds
to three sets of five reps every workout. Try them all and see what
works best for you. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre5"><span
class="bold"><span>Dips</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The parallel-bar dip is a movement
borrowed from gymnastics. It consists of supporting yourself by the
arms, between and above two parallel bars, lowering your body down, and
then driving it back up. The dip is a good substitute for the bench
press if it cannot be done for some reason, and is far superior to the
decline bench press, which there is no good reason to do. If the “lower
pecs” and triceps are the object of your desire – the apple of your eye,
as it were – then dips are your exercise. They are better than the
decline because, like any good exercise, they involve the movement of
lots of your muscles, besides the lower pecs and triceps. In this case,
dips involve the movement of your entire body; they are like pushups in
this respect. They are better than pushups because they can be weighted
– and thus incrementally increased in load – and performed alone,
whereas pushups cannot be weighted conveniently even with two people
involved. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The quality of an exercise increases
with the involvement of more muscles, more joints, and more central
nervous system activity needed to control them. The more of the body
involved in an exercise, the more of these criteria are met. When the
whole body moves, a more nearly ideal state is achieved, with lots of
muscles and nerves controlling lots of joints, and the central nervous
system keeping track of lots of different pieces of the body doing many
different things, hopefully correctly. By this logic, pushups are better
than bench presses since pushups involve the movement and control of the
entire body. But they are very difficult to do weighted, especially
alone, because of the problems with loading the human body in this
position. Were it possible, a good weighted pushup device would be in
use today.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>It has long been assumed that the bench
press has solved that problem, when in fact it hasn’t. The only thing
moving in the bench press is the arms, so in this particular way the
bench is to the pushup what the lat pulldown is to the pull-up. But the
bench does allow the same approximate movement to be loaded, and has
allowed many people to increase their pushup numbers without high-rep
pushups. Without adding weight, a fit person will find it difficult to
train a pressing motion moving in the anterior direction without using
very high reps, which are seldom appropriate for most training goals.
Dips address both problems, allowing heavy weights to be used while the
entire body moves during an upper-body exercise.</span></span></p>

<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Unweighted dips are harder than pushups
because the whole body is moving, not just the part that isn’t supported
by the feet. And for the more advanced trainee, dips are very easy to
use weighted, either by hanging plates or other objects from a belt or
by holding a dumbbell between the feet (an option which works well only
for light weights). The anterior aspect of the movement is provided by
the slightly inclined torso position, a function of the fact that the
forearms stay vertical during the whole movement. If the body’s mass is
to be evenly distributed relative to the position of the hands on the
bars – i.e., half of the mass in front of the hands and half of it
behind the hands – then the body will have to assume an inclined
position during the movement. There is enough angle to provide for a
tremendous amount of pec involvement, using primarily the lower part of
the muscle belly. And since the arms are operating downward relative to
the upper body, the lats are also involved in the adduction of the
humerus, adding even more muscle mass to the exercise.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Heavy weights can be used in this
exercise, and many powerlifters have used it to maintain bench strength
while an injury heals, one that the bench aggravates but that dips do
not. Dips can be used unweighted for high reps or weighted, just like
the bench would be trained, as a progressively loaded lift. The
whole-body effects are felt more as weight increases, with very heavy
efforts producing fatigue throughout the trunk and
arms.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Dips are best done on a set of dip bars,
a station designed for this purpose; most modern gyms do not have a set
of parallel bars as might be found in a gymnastics studio or,
previously, most gyms.<br />

<br />
<br />
Dip-station bars are usually 24–26 inches wide, and the most comfortable
ones are made out of 1¼- or 1½-inch pipe or bar stock. They are between
48 and 54 inches high, tall enough to allow the trainee’s feet to
completely clear the ground at the bottom of the dip. They really,
really need to be stable, either attached to a wall or built with enough
base that any possible amount of wobble during the movement will not tip
the bars. A non-parallel station, with the bars at a 30-degree angle,
allows for a variety of grip widths that can more closely approximate
the press, bench press, or jerk grip without adversely affecting the
neutral hand orientation. But in a pinch (or a motel room), two chairs
can serve as a dip station if they are stable when turned back to
back.<br />

<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>To perform dips, select your grip and
jump up into position on the bars, with your elbows locked and chest up.
Take a big breath and hold it; start down by unlocking your elbows and
leaning forward a little; and continue down until your shoulders are
below your elbows. This position is easily identified by someone
watching you; the humerus at the shoulder will dip below parallel. This
criterion ensures a complete range of motion, plus a good stretch for
the pecs. It also provides a way to judge the completeness of the rep –
a way to quantify the work and compare performances between two people,
thus serving the same purpose that the below-parallel criterion does in
the squat. Drive your body up out of the bottom stretched position until
your elbows are locked out, raising your chest into position directly
above your hands on the bar. Exhale at the top after finishing the rep,
and when you need a breath, be sure to take it only when you’re locked
out at the top. Don’t exhale during the rep; the pressure provides rib
cage support that is important for effective control of the body while
it is moving. </span></span></p>

<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The two most common errors in performing
dips involve the completeness of the movement. Most people, when not
being yelled at about it, will cut the depth off above parallel. They do
this because it is easier to do a partial dip than a full dip, just as
it’s easier to do a partial squat than a full squat. A partial dip does
not carry the injury potential that a partial squat does. But partial
dips are not as valuable as deep dips for the same reason that
half-squats are less than adequate: they work less muscle mass. If you
go to the trouble of loading a dip belt to do the exercise weighted, and
then cheat the depth, you are just wasting training time and kidding
yourself about how strong you are, just like when you cheat any other
exercise. Do your dips deep, with a lighter weight if necessary, so you
don’t miss the actual benefit.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The other problem is a failure to lock
out the elbows at the top between reps. This is not the heinous crime
that cutting off the depth is, because it is usually unintentional.
Tired triceps don’t always know they are not completely contracted. The
chest-up position at the finish helps cue the elbow lockout because it
pulls the mass of the upper part of the torso behind the hands so that
the triceps can extend the elbows against a more evenly distributed
load.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>And gentlemen, when you’re doing
weighted dips with a chain and a belt, be sure to arrange the chain and
plates in such a way as to minimize the chance of damage to the
important structures that are in unfortunate proximity, in the event of
a loss of control or a swinging plate. </span></span></p>

<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Ring dips are best left to gymnasts or
other people at lighter bodyweights who are not training primarily for
strength. Ring dips are a dangerous movement for your shoulders, and
weighted ring dips are foolish for anybody; it doesn’t take very much
lateral movement of the rings to place the shoulder joints in a position
of such instability that it cannot be controlled. The shoulders can
easily be impinged during a dip because the load is driving the humerus
and AC joint together, and the addition of lateral moment force to the
configuration has resulted in many avoidable surgical repairs to many
rotator cuffs (see <a
href="#filepos311005"
class="calibre9">Figure 3-7</a>). Do your shoulders a favor, and just do
your dips on bars.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Barbell
rows</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>First, </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="bold">barbell rows are not a substitute
for power cleans.</span></span></span><span> If you use them for this
purpose, you have decided to omit a more important exercise in favor of
an assistance exercise, an easier movement that does not provide most of
the benefits of the more important basic exercise. I say this because of
the prevalence of this substitution since the second edition of this
book was published. Power cleans are one of the primary constituents of
the program, and barbell rows – useful as they may be to intermediate
lifters – are not. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Now that this is out of the way, let’s
get one more thing out of the way. Most people associate rows with
machines that place you in a position to do them; cable rows or the
machine version of the T-bar rows are the most common. But the most
valuable rowing exercise is the one that makes you assume the position
and maintain it throughout the set. This way, you get the benefits of
both moving the bar through the rowing motion and doing the stability
work needed to hold your back in the right position to do the rowing
motion. As with all beneficial barbell training, the more work you have
to do during the exercise, the better the exercise. So let’s learn how
to do a proper barbell row.</span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Barbell rows start on the floor and end
on the floor, each and every rep. The bar does not hang from the arms
between reps. Each rep is separated by a breath and a reset of the lower
back. Starting from the floor enables the hamstrings and glutes to help
get the bar moving, so that the lats and scapula retractors can finish a
heavier weight than they could from a dead hang in the arms. Done this
way, the exercise works not only the lats, upper back, and arms – the
muscles typically associated with rowing – but the low back and hip
extensors as well. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>When you are rowing from the floor, the
most critical factor in technique is the position of the lower back. The
lumbar spine must be held in extension, just like it is in a deadlift
and for exactly the same reason. A major difference between rows and
deadlifts is the fact that in rows, the back angle changes as the bar
comes off the floor; the knees are already extended and are not really
involved much, so the hip extensors contribute to the initial pull from
the floor by raising the chest using the locked back, transmitting this
force to the bar. The finish occurs as the elbows bend and slam the bar
into the lower rib cage area. The bar will leave the floor from a
position directly below the scapulas, just as in a deadlift; but in a
barbell row, unlike a deadlift, the back angle will never become
vertical, and will not rise much higher than the shoulders at about
15–20 degrees above horizontal. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Approach the bar with a deadlift stance,
maybe not quite as close; light weights can be pulled in a curved bar
path to the belly as you warm up, but as the weight gets heavier,
standard pulling mechanics will prevail and the bar will operate
vertically over the mid-foot, as it does in all heavy pulling exercises.
As weight is added, the bar will adjust itself to the correct position
over the foot, whether you want it to or not. The grip width can vary
quite a bit, but a grip that’s about the same as the bench-press width
is perhaps the best place to start. With heavier weights, you can use a
hook grip or straps. Your eyes should be fixed on the floor a few feet
in front of you. Don’t look straight down, but don’t try to look
straight forward, either, because doing so will extend your neck too
much. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Take a big breath, raise the bar from
the floor with straight elbows to get it moving, and continue bringing
it up by bending your elbows and slamming the bar into the upper part of
your belly. This movement leads with the elbows, and you should think
about slamming your elbows into the ceiling. The most important part of
the technique of the barbell row is the back position: the spine must be
locked into extension, with the chest up and the lower back arched, the
whole time the bar is moving. After the bar contacts your belly, lower
the bar back to the floor, exhale and take a new breath, and reset your
back before each rep. Don’t attempt to hold the bar against your belly
at the top or lower the bar too slowly; the barbell row is like the
deadlift in that the work is intended to be mainly concentric. Since
heavier weights will essentially be dropped, you’ll want to use bumper
plates for rowing, or use rubber mats under your standard iron plates.

stops on the floor. </span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The row requires that the bar be started
off the floor with a hip extension, not a knee extension. With light
weights, you can perform rows with just your arms, but as you approach
work-set weights, hip extension becomes more important. Your knees will
be almost straight, just slightly unlocked, with your hips higher than
they would be in a deadlift before the bar moves up – the same position
used to start a stiff-legged deadlift – so that there is little chance
the quads can be used. The movement starts with your arms straight and
with your chest coming up, raising your back angle slightly as the bar
leaves the floor – a movement performed with the hamstrings and glutes
acting on the rigid back, which is held in isometric contraction by the
erectors. This initial hip extension starts the weight up, and your
elbows catch the momentum and carry the bar on up with a shoulder
extension and scapula retraction. The lats, triceps, biceps, forearm
muscles, posterior deltoids, and smaller muscles around the shoulder
blades are the prime movers here. The trunk muscles that stabilize the
spine enable the trunk to act as a rigid platform, against which the
force can be generated. The hamstrings and glutes, after their initial
action off the ground, act to anchor the pelvis, and therefore the lower
back, during the final rowing motion generated by the upper body. As is
so often the case in complex human movement, muscles change actions
during the course of the activity, starting off with one function and
ending with another, and the function of the hip extensors during the
barbell row is a good example of this shift. </span></span></p>

supine-grip barbell row has the lats working across the back where the
fibers of the muscle bellies are roughly parallel to the bar.
</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Rows are not useful at weights so heavy
that form is hard to maintain. The finish position, when the bar touches
the belly, is controlled by some of the same factors that limit a clean,
in that a weight that can be rowed correctly may be only 15 pounds
lighter than a weight that cannot be rowed at all. A row that is not
finished will not engage the range of motion that is unique to the
exercise, and thus might as well be called a “partial SLDL.” For this
reason, sets of five or more reps are used, since weights that can be
rowed for only a triple probably cannot be done correctly anyway. As
with any ancillary exercise, it is much better to get good reps with a
lighter weight for sets of 5, 8, or 10 and do several across than to
lose the benefit of the exercise with a weight that is too
heavy.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The first few reps will use only a
slight – maybe less than 10 degrees – amount of hip extension, but as
the set progresses and the upper body becomes fatigued, more hip
extension gets thrown in to get the reps finished. Be sure to continue
doing rows and not deadlifts. Your back should never get much above
horizontal, and if your chest comes up too high on the last reps, the
bar is hitting too low, the range of motion for the target muscles has
shortened, and the weight is therefore too heavy.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>As the weight gets heavy, there will be
a pronounced tendency to allow your chest to drop down to meet the bar,
completing the rep from the top down instead of from the bottom up. When
this chest drop becomes excessive, the weight is too heavy. And
“excessive” is a rather subjective concept here. Someone might decide
that no chest drop is allowable, in which case heavy weights cannot be
used in the exercise. Or someone might decide that as long as the chest
can be touched with the bar, the rep counts. This degree of variability
is one of the things that distinguish an ancillary exercise from a
primary exercise: if a large degree of variability is inherent in the
performance of an exercise, it cannot be judged effectively or
quantified objectively. For this reason, the barbell row makes a very
good ancillary exercise but a very poor contest lift. </span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>A variation on the standard barbell row
is to supinate the grip, thus adding more biceps to the exercise. This
reverse-grip row is irritating to the elbows in inflexible people; the
rather extreme degree of external rotation of the humerus, combined with
the completely supine hand, is irritating to the forearm muscles’
insertion points on the elbows when they are flexed with a heavy weight,
even though this rotation is usually tolerated well for chin-ups. The
reverse-grip row can produce tennis or golfer’s elbow very quickly, so
if you decide to try this version of the movement, start with light
weights and cautiously work up to your heavier sets the first time or
two. And use a narrower grip than you would for the prone-grip version
to minimize the grip position problems.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>There are a couple of ancillary
exercises that require special equipment but are useful enough to make
it worth locating. The Roman chair is an old piece of gym equipment that
can be found in one form or another in most training facilities. It was
developed in the late 1800s by the famous physical culturist Professor
Louis “Attila” Durlacher from a device known as a “Roman column” that
served a similar function. The Roman chair is a very basic bench (a
bench has no parts that move during an exercise; a machine does) that
supports the trainee’s shins or feet from the top while supporting the
thighs from below, thus allowing the trainee to be in a horizontal
position, supported by his legs. You can use the Roman chair while
facing up for abdominal work or while facing down for back work.

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Ab workouts done on this bench are
called </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">Roman

exercise has been for many years referred to as a “hyperextension,”
although that term specifically refers to a position that most joints
don’t like to be placed in, so the exercise is therefore preferably
termed simply a “back extension.” You may hear “hyperextension” used for
the exercise from time to time, but it is losing its place as more

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The back extension is a very good way to
directly work the spinal erectors using both concentric and eccentric
contractions. The normal function of the trunk muscles is stabilization
of the spine, using an isometric contraction that allows little or no
relative movement of the vertebrae. But the trunk muscles can be
strengthened by the active motion of the spine during this exercise,
which functions like a reverse sit-up; the erectors extend the spine
from a flexed position over a broad range of motion. The fact that the
spine is extended in a position parallel to the floor is a function of
the simultaneous hip extension, which the glutes (all of them, the
maximus, medius, and minimus), hamstrings, and adductors perform in
coordination with the spinal extension.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>You perform the back extension by
assuming a face-down position in a Roman chair, with the middle of your
thighs on the front pad, the back of your legs (just below the calves
and just above the heels, right on the Achilles tendon) jammed up into
the foot pad or roller pad, and your body held parallel to the floor.
Keep your knees very slightly unlocked but not bent, with just a little
tension from the hamstrings protecting the knees from hyperextension.
The movement is an eccentric spinal extension – just let your chest drop
down toward the upright of the bench, until your torso is perpendicular
to the floor – and then an concentric spinal extension, raising the
chest, followed by a hip extension, which kicks in the glutes and
hamstrings to finish the exercise with the torso parallel to the floor.
It is important to lead up with the chest, making it draw the back into
extension – a full arch at the top of the movement. It works the spinal
erectors, the glutes, and the upper hamstring
function.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The glute/ham bench is a modified Roman
chair that allows the back extension to be carried on up into a
bodyweight “leg curl” in an exercise called a </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">glute/ham
raise</span></span></span><span>. Glute/ham benches are becoming more
popular as more people figure out the utility of the glute/ham raise. In
the finish position of the glute/ham raise, your torso is vertical. This
exercise thus includes all the elements of the back extension but with
lots and </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">lots</span></span></span><span> more hamstring
involvement. The modification that allows this added movement is a plate
welded onto the frame right behind the foot roller (<a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_011.html#filepos1046512"
class="calibre9">Figure 7-51</a>). This plate gives the feet a place to
push against, allowing a knee flexion to occur which carries the torso
and thighs on up to the vertical position. The hamstrings can do this
with the plate against the feet because they have the help of the
gastrocnemius, which cannot contribute to knee flexion unless its
proximal function is facilitated by having its distal function blocked
against the plate. </span></span></p>

<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Muscles that cross two joints can affect
movement around either joint. The </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">proximal
function</span></span></span><span> is that which is performed by the
joint closest to the center of the body, and the </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">distal
function</span></span></span><span> is performed on the other end of the
bone, the one farthest away. Most of the joints in the body are moved by
muscles that also attach across another joint. The hamstrings are
perhaps the most classic example because they both extend the hips and
flex the knees – the glute/ham raise causes them to do both. The gastroc
is another example of this type of muscle; it attaches to the calcaneus,
or heel bone, by the Achilles tendon, and attaches to the lateral and
medial epicondyles of the femur, behind the knee, as it splits into
right and left heads. The gastroc both extends the ankle (an action
referred to as “plantar flexion” in this particular instance) and flexes
the knee. The other major calf muscle, the soleus, shares the Achilles
tendon with the gastroc but attaches proximally to the tibia and
therefore does not cross the knee.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The glute/ham bench takes advantage of
this anatomy and gives the feet a surface to push against. The weight of
the body out in front of the forward pad traps the heels against the
roller, allowing the body to be levered up, while the tension of the
calves holds the feet against the plate. The plate blocks the ankle
extension so that the contraction of the gastrocs is transmitted to the
femoral insertions, causing the knees to flex. The glute/ham raise is
essentially a back extension until the torso is parallel to the ground,
where the hips have extended as well as the spine. Then the feet push
the plate, and the knee flexion adds to the upward momentum generated by
the back extension, carrying the torso on up to a vertical position,
with the knees flexed at 90 degrees, the back and hips in extension, and
the chest up. </span></span></p>

<br />

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure
7-52.</span></span></span><span> The glute/ham raise is essentially a
back extension followed immediately by a bodyweight leg curl. The knee
flexion can be completed because the feet are blocked by the plate,
enabling the calf muscles to contribute their proximal function to knee
flexion. Without the plate, you won’t be able to fully flex the knees
and reach an upright position, as shown in <a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_011.html#filepos1052091"
class="calibre9">Figure 7-53</a>. </span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The glutes engage more strongly here
than they do in a simple back extension. They help generate momentum
through the transition between the back extension and the knee flexion.
Depending on the individual, the glutes might not be particularly
perceptible as they work in the exercise. The trainee might not feel the
glutes much because of the huge contribution of the hamstrings working
over a much longer range of motion, and because the glutes contract very
efficiently over a shorter distance, since their origin and insertion
points are not that far apart. The poorer the conditioning of the
athlete, especially with regard to the squat, the more noticeable the
glutes will be in this exercise. And the poorer the conditioning, the
less likely the trainee will actually be able to do an entire set of 10,
or even a complete rep. Glute/ham raises are hard at first, but get
easier very quickly as the movement pattern and the trainee’s associated
neuromuscular efficiency improve. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The movement is performed in essentially
the same way as a back extension until the spine reaches the full arched
position, which must occur in a coordinated fashion or the timing will
be off. The knees then kick in to finish raising the chest up all the
way to vertical. The best cue for this is the chest: think about raising
your chest up fast and hard, and the hamstrings, calves, and glutes will
do their job at the right time. The hands are held either crossed on the
chest, the easier way, or with fingers locked behind the head, the
harder way because more mass is farther away from the hips. Glute/hams
like to be done at higher reps; 10 to 15 for three to five sets works
best.</span></span></p>

</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>In this exercise, you are lifting the
part of your body that is in front of the pad with muscles located
behind the pad, and the more mass there is in front of the pad, the
harder the job is to do. Most glute/ham benches are adjustable between
the front and back pads for this reason, and the difficulty of the
movement can be adjusted accordingly. Set the front pad back far enough
to ensure that your crotch clears the pad, for rather obvious reasons,
and to make the exercise hard enough for you to get enough work out of
it. But be careful about setting the back pad so far forward that the
front pad is too close to your knees. This position does increase the
difficulty, but it also dramatically increases the amount of shear force
on the knees, which are, after all, only held together by the cruciate
ligaments, the capsular ligaments, and muscular tension. More-advanced
lifters can carry weight behind the neck or on the chest to increase the
work if necessary.</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic"> It is much better to add load with weight than with
leverage in this exercise.</span></span></span><span> </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>When your thighs slide or roll down the
pads, you have allowed allow your knees to bend before you have
completed the back extension. Remember: anytime the knees bend, the
hamstrings shorten. If you allow this to happen before you finish the
back-extension phase of the movement, then 1) you have contracted the
hamstrings without making them do any actual work, since they haven’t
contributed to the lifting up of the torso, and 2) you have placed them
in a position of partial contraction, where they cannot contribute a
full contraction to the exercise after the back-extension phase has
finished. </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="bold">Don’t
let your knees slide down from the thigh pad before your chest is up and
your hips are extended.</span></span></span><span> This is the most
common error people make, and it ruins the effect of the exercise. And
for the same reason, do not do glute/ham raises on a bench constructed
with rollers for the front pad. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>When you first start doing them,
glute/ham raises may be very hard. Typically, an untrained person cannot
do a complete rep all the way up to vertical. This is fine; just come up
as high as you can for each rep of the set, even though that height will
deteriorate as the set goes on. The exercise gets easier very fast, as
mentioned before, primarily because you learn how to do it more
efficiently very quickly. Within six or seven workouts, most people can
perform at least one complete rep. When you can do several sets all the
way up, add load after a warm-up set by holding a plate to your chest or
a bar behind your neck.</span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>A good definition of “functional
exercise” is a normal human movement that can be performed under a
scalable, increasable load. By this definition, neither back extensions
of any type nor sit-ups are functional exercises. Some people have
trouble with them, taking the form of chronic back pain or a tendency to
get repeated small back injuries. The normal function of all the muscles
surrounding the spine is spinal stabilization, and the squat, press, and
all pulling exercises provide plenty of work for these muscles by
challenging their function along with those of the prime movers of the
exercise. If you are an older lifter with a degree of the normal spinal
degeneration that accompanies advancing age, you might decide that
eccentric and concentric back work and flexion-based abdominal work
cause more problems than they correct. If you are continually plagued
with lower-back injuries, try eliminating all exercises involving spinal
flexion and extension for a few weeks and see what happens to the injury
frequency. Your abs and back muscles will remain strong from doing their
primary jobs under the bar, and you’ll stop having injury problems that
interfere with your training.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre5"><span
class="bold"><span>Curls</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Since you’re going to do them anyway, we
might as well discuss the right way to do curls. Curls are performed to
train the biceps, a muscle that commands an inordinate amount of
attention from far too many people. But that is the nature of things,
and who are we to question so fundamental a matter? Effective curls
require an awareness of the biceps anatomy and a willingness to diverge
from the conventional wisdom regarding technique. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The biceps muscle is one of the many
muscles of the body that crosses two joints. (Technically, this muscle
is the </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">biceps
brachii</span></span></span><span>, or “arm” biceps, which is distinct
from the </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">biceps femoris</span></span></span><span>, one of the
hamstring muscles.) Like its partner the triceps, the
biceps</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">
</span></span></span><span>crosses both the elbow and shoulder joints,
and therefore causes movement to occur around both joints. The chin-up
uses a combination of elbow flexion and shoulder extension. But so does
the pull-up, the difference being the prone versus supine grip. The
elbow flexion during the pull-up is performed without much biceps
involvement, while the biceps are heavily involved in the chin-up.
</span></span></p>
<br />
<span class="calibre1"></span>
<p><span class="calibre7"><img src="./images/00645.jpg" class="calibre8"

<br />

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure 7-54.
</span></span></span><span> Both the biceps (A) and the triceps (B)
muscles cross the elbow and shoulder joints, causing movement around
both. </span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>This difference is due to the anatomy of
the elbow. The distal end of the biceps attaches to the radius – the
shorter of the two forearm bones – at a point called the
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">radial
tuberosity</span></span></span><span>, located on the posterior and
medial aspects of the radius when the forearm is pronated (the palm is
facing back). “Supination” is the term given to the position in which
the hand is rotated forward and the palm is up, and the palm-up position
of the hand is referred to as “supine.” The forearm supinates when the
biceps attachment on the radius rotates inward and upward as the muscle
shortens. In fact, if the biceps are in full contraction, the hand is
supine. The pull-up, performed with a prone grip, utilizes very little
biceps – and therefore proportionately more triceps and lats – while the
chin-up uses lots of biceps. The elbow-flexion part of the pull-up is
accomplished by the other elbow flexors: the brachialis, the
brachioradialis, and some of the smaller forearm
muscles.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The biceps also performs the movement
known as shoulder flexion. Anatomical movement descriptions can
sometimes be arbitrary, and flexion in the shoulder joint is defined as
the forward and upward movement of the humerus. The biceps contributes
to this movement because the proximal attachments (yes, there are two,
thus the name </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">bi</span></span></span><span>ceps) are located on the
anterior (forward) side of the scapula, the main bone of the shoulder
joint. Because the tendon attachments cross the joint, the muscle moves
the joint, and shoulder flexion is therefore a biceps function.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Elbow flexion, along with shoulder
extension, is used whenever anything is grasped and pulled in toward the
body. This is why chin-ups and pull-ups are such functional exercises:
they duplicate this very normal motion under a load (<a

<br />

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure
7-55.</span></span></span><span> Chin-ups are an example of an exercise
involving elbow flexion (a function of the distal biceps and forearm)
and shoulder extension (a function of the lats and proximal
triceps).</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />
In fact, elbow flexion is normally accompanied by shoulder extension;
this is the way the arm is designed to work. And this is why elbow
flexion with an immobile shoulder requires special equipment: the
preacher curl was invented for the purpose of providing a way to work
the biceps in isolation. The isolation of a single muscle group that
moves a single joint seldom contributes significantly to other, more
complex movements which include that muscle group. Remember that our
definition of “functional exercise” is a normal human movement that can
be performed under a scalable, increasable load. By this definition, no
exercise that requires a machine or specific device to perform it can be
a functional exercise (we’re not including the barbell or power rack in
the “specific device” category here, since we can’t limit our training
to the use of sticks and rocks). And if a muscle is isolated in an
exercise, its tendon attachments are, too; this fact has a bearing on
the injury-causing potential of these types of exercises.
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Examples of shoulder flexion are harder
to find, since raising things overhead is generally accomplished with a
prone hand and a pressing motion that relies primarily on the deltoids
and triceps. Shoulder flexion with a supine forearm pretty much
exclusively occurs during exercise. But since the biceps do perform this
function, it should be incorporated into biceps training so that this
function gets worked – curls should involve shoulder flexion because
they can. Barbell curls allow for both elbow flexion and shoulder
flexion, they utilize a normal function of the arms, and they do not
require specialized equipment (again, the bar being considered
non-specialized). So barbell curls could be considered a functional
exercise in the strict sense of the definition. </span></span></p>

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>There are as many ways to do curls as
there are muscle-magazine authors. If you’re going to spend time doing
all these variations, you have missed the point of this book. Let’s
assume that you haven’t, and that you want the best way to work the most
biceps in the least time. That way is the barbell curl, done with a
standard Olympic bar. It is performed standing (since it cannot be
performed seated), and it is best done out of a rack set at the same
height that it would be for the press. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Approach the bar with a supine grip,
with the width varying between somewhat closer than shoulder width and
several inches wider. The wider the grip, the greater the degree of
supination that will be required to maintain that grip; the greater the
supination, the more the biceps will be contracted at full flexion.
Depending on individual flexibility, a grip just wider than the
shoulders will allow the full effects of the exercise to be expressed
(this will be about the same grip used for the chin-up, for the same
reasons). </span></span></p>

<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>This version of the barbell curl starts
at the top, with your elbows in full flexion, as opposed to the more
common method of starting at the bottom with extended elbows. When the
bar is lowered to full extension and then raised back into flexion
without a pause at the bottom, the biceps get the benefit of utilizing a
stretch reflex to contract harder, thereby allowing the use of more
weight. Breathing is done only at the top, with none of the supportive
pressure released at the bottom. The elbows are kept against the rib
cage and start from a position in front of the bar. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The barbell curl, like the goodmorning,
intentionally uses a bar path that deviates from the mid-foot balance
point. You lower the weight eccentrically in an arc, away from your
body. In doing so, you create moment arms – between the bar and your
elbows, between the bar and your shoulders, and between the bar and the
mid-foot – so that you are intentionally manipulating the mechanics of
the system to create the resistance. Keep your elbows against your ribs,
in front of the mid-axial line that separates front from back. As your
elbows get almost straight at the bottom of the curl, they slide back
into a position behind this line. The elbows never straighten
completely, because doing so would mean that tension is off the biceps,
but they get close. Some tension is needed to initiate the concentric
flexion that comprises the essence of the movement, and perfectly
straight elbows make this very hard and inefficient. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Start the upward phase of the curl by
sliding your elbows forward as you move the bar in the same arc that it
moved in on the way down. Elbows stay against the ribs the whole way up;
this keeps the hands in supination by maintaining the supine position of
the forearm. A good cue for this position is to think about pushing the
medial pad of the palm – the part just above the wrist and on the
little-finger side of the hand – into the bar, as if this were the only
part of the hand in contact with the bar.<br />
<br />

“hypothenar eminence” (see <a
href="#filepos320882"
class="calibre9">Figure 3-10</a>) – is the key to ensuring maximum
supination during a curl. Push the bar up while thinking about using
this part of the hand. </span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />
You will need to keep your wrists in a neutral position, neither flexed
nor extended but in a position that keeps the metacarpal bones of the
hand in line with the forearm. Drive the bar back up to the starting
position, keeping your hands supine and your elbows on your ribs. During
this upward phase, your elbows will move forward to return to their
position in front of the bar, producing shoulder flexion in addition to
elbow flexion. It is common to see the elbows leave the rib cage and
assume a position in line with, or even outside, the hands on the bar.
This error involves the deltoids in the movement and reduces the biceps’
involvement. Keep your elbows close to your ribs and make them slide
forward on the way up.
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>During the curl, it will be very
difficult to maintain a perfectly upright posture if you use any weight
at all. The lifter/barbell system must balance over the middle of the
foot, which means that as the bar moves forward through its arc, the
body must balance the mass of the bar by leaning back. The heavier the
weight, the more the lean. It is neither necessary, desirable, nor
possible to try to stay strictly upright during a heavy barbell curl. If
you are training for strength, you must use heavier weights, and you
will find that the physics of placing a heavy bar in front and your body
in back cannot be circumvented. Do not flex or extend your knees at all,
or let an excessive amount of upward movement out of the bottom be
initiated by the hips instead of the elbows. “Excessive” is a judgment
call – once again we see why some exercises are “ancillary.” Cheat curls
are a legitimate exercise, depending on what you want out of the
movement. If a heavy weight is started with a little hip extension and
finished with a substantial amount of unassisted elbow and shoulder
flexion, the cheat curl is probably legit. But if you start it with your
hips and knees and then dive under the bar to receive it in full elbow
flexion, you are doing a reverse-grip clean, defeating the purpose of
the exercise, risking several injuries, and inviting the criticism of
more experienced, disciplined lifters.</span></span></p>

being the one most frequently seen in magazines and exercise books, and
being the easiest to do while looking in the mirror. But the simple
pressdown only works the distal triceps function – elbow extension – and
ignores the fact that the triceps crosses both the shoulder and the
elbow and therefore has a proximal function as well. Shoulder extension
is the proximal function, and the most efficient triceps exercises
incorporate both functions. Cable pressdowns can be done in this manner,
but they have an interesting limitation: as you get stronger, you will
eventually be able to use enough weight that your feet cannot stay on
the floor. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>There is a better triceps exercise, one
that is so effective at building lockout strength for the bench press
that Larry Pacifico called it “the fourth powerlift.” It is the
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">lying triceps
extension</span></span></span><span> (LTE), done on a flat bench in a
supine position with heavy weights. Done correctly, it is safe, brutally
hard, and very effective for general upper-body strength with an
emphasis on the triceps. Done the way many foolish people do it – as a
“skullcrusher” – it loses much of its effectiveness and safety.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The preferred equipment for the LTE is
the EZ Curl bar, a cambered bar intended for doing curls as an
alternative to using a straight bar. The EZ Curl bar was invented back
in the early 1970s by some poor bastard who probably didn’t make a dime
off of the thing. It apparently ended up with one of the big magazine
publishers who also happened to sell equipment and who started marketing
it as his own device. Typical situation. </span></span></p>

extensions.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span> The problem is that the EZ Curl bar
doesn’t work nearly as well for curls and for recruiting biceps
contraction as a straight bar does. As we discussed earlier, the degree
of supination of the forearm and hand directly affects the amount of
biceps in contraction. The EZ Curl bar does in fact take the stress of
supination off of the wrists and elbows, but it does so at the expense
of a good biceps contraction. The camber of the bar is specifically
intended to decrease the supination of the forearm, and anything less
than full supination results in a less-than-complete biceps
contraction.</span></span></p>

contraction, and the main reason that the EZ Curl bar is best left for
triceps work. </span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>But the EZ Curl bar works perfectly for
the lying triceps extension. The triceps is composed of three bundles of
muscles, which originate on the humerus and the scapula and share a
common insertion point on the olecranon process of the elbow. (The
lateral and medial heads of the triceps originate on the humerus; the
long head originates on the scapula.) The angle of the hand on the bar
makes no difference in the quality of the triceps contraction. The more
prone grip afforded by the EZ Curl bar is more comfortable for this
exercise and does not reduce its effectiveness.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The thing that distinguishes the LTE
from other triceps exercises is the inclusion of the proximal function
of the triceps, where the design of the movement produces shoulder
extension, using the long head of the muscle, as well as elbow
extension. It also includes the lats, some pec, costal muscle, and
abdominal involvement, and the forearms. This exercise dramatically
increases the number of other muscles activated and is the first choice
when you are adding a triceps assistance exercise to your
program.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The LTE, like the bench press, requires
a spotter at heavy weights. Take a position on the bench, with the top
of your head just past the edge of the pad. Receive the bar from the
spotter, who has deadlifted it into position, handed it to you, and
stepped back out of the way. The EZ Curl bar has three angles in the
middle; take your grip on the inside-most angle with your hands prone
(palms facing up), and the middle bend in the bar facing down. Your
elbows will be pointed down the bench in external rotation, and the bar
will be locked out over your shoulder joints, as in a bench press. Your
chest should be up, butt in contact with the bench, feet in a stable
position on the floor, and eyes looking at the ceiling for the whole rep

<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Unlock your elbows while keeping your
upper arms vertical, letting the bar arc backward behind your head and
toward the floor. When your elbows get to about 90 degrees, let your
shoulders rotate back to drop the bar down just above your head,
touching your hair, down to about the level of the bench. This motion
will stretch your triceps, deltoids, and lats, and when the bar is just
below the level of the back of your head, let the stretch turn the rep
around and start back up. Pull the bar back up with your elbows, and as
they approach the top, extend them to lock out the bar in the start
position.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Keep the bar as close to the top of your
head as possible while stretching down to the bench, and lead up with
the stretch reflex, like you’re throwing the bar at the ceiling and
using your elbows to start the throw. The stretch reflex adds a lot of
range of motion – and power, if you move explosively – to the movement,
making the LTE much more useful than the standard “skullcrusher.” If you
keep your elbows too straight and let the bar go back too far away from
the top of your head, you lose some of the ROM around the elbows. A big
breath at the top inflates the chest and makes the stretch reflex at the
bottom more effective. When the LTE is done in this way, both shoulder
extension and elbow extension are used, and more triceps mass is
stressed over a longer ROM. Do sets of 10–15 reps with this
exercise.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Barbell Training:
There’s Just No Substitute</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>There are lots of useless assistance
exercises which contribute nothing to the performance of the major
exercises or of sports activities, and which might do worse than merely
waste time. Exercises that use only one joint, and that usually require
machines to do, are non-functional in the sense that they do not follow
a normal human movement pattern. They also quite often predispose the
joint to overuse injuries, and the vast majority of weight room injuries
are produced by these exercises. This is true not only by default, since
it is obvious that in a world where most people only use machines, most
of the injuries will occur on machines. Isolation exercises cause
tendinitis because human joints are not designed to be subjected to the
stress of movements in which all of the shock, moment force, tension,
and compression are exclusively applied to one joint. There is no
movement that can be performed outside the modern health club that
involves only the quadriceps; the only way to isolate the quads is to do
an exercise on a machine designed for that purpose. This is a function
that hundreds of millions of years of vertebrate evolution did not
anticipate. The knee is the home of many muscles, all of which have
developed while working at the same time. Any exercise that deviates
from the function for which the joint is designed contributes very
little to the function of that joint and is a potential source of
problems. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Exercise machines have made several
people a lot of money, and while there’s absolutely nothing wrong with
that, they have been a very large diversion from more productive forms
of training. The pendulum swings, and barbell training is once again
being recognized as the superior form of exercise. Glad we could help.

<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>It is May 15, and you decide that this
year you are going to get a suntan – a glorious, beautiful, tropical
suntan. So you decide to go out in the back yard (to spare the neighbors
and innocent passersby) to lay out at lunchtime and catch a ray or two.
You lie on your back for 15 minutes and flip over to lie on your belly
for 15 minutes. Then you get up, come in and eat lunch, and go back to
work. That night, your skin is a little pink, so the next day you just
eat lunch, but the following day you’re back outside for your
15-minutes-per-side sunbath. You are faithful to your schedule, spending
30 minutes outside every day that week, because that’s the kind of
disciplined, determined person you are. At the end of the week, you have
turned a more pleasant shade of brown and, heartened by your results,
resolve to maintain your schedule for the rest of the month. So, here is
the critical question: what color is your skin at the end of the month?
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>If you ask a hundred people this
question, ninety-five will tell you that it will be really, really dark.
But in fact it will be exactly the same color it was at the end of the
first week. Why would it be any darker? Your skin adapts to the stress
of the sun exposure by becoming dark enough to prevent itself from
burning again. That’s the ONLY reason it gets dark, and it adapts
exactly and specifically to the stress that burned it. Your skin does
not “know” that you want it to get darker; it only “knows” what the sun
tells it, and the sun only talked to it for 15 minutes. It can’t get any
darker than the 15 minutes makes it get, because the 15 minutes is what
it is adapting to. If you just got darker every time you were exposed to
the sun, we’d all be black, especially those of us who live in a sunny
area, since we all get out of the car and walk into the house or work
several times a day. The skin adapts not to total accumulated exposure
but to the </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">longest</span></span></span><span> exposure – the hardest
exposure. If you want your skin to get darker, you have to stay out
longer in order to give the skin more </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">stress</span></span></span><span>
than it has already adapted to. The widespread failure to comprehend
this pivotal aspect of adaptation is why so few people actually
understand exercise programming.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Exercise follows exactly the same
principle as getting a tan – a stress is imposed on the body and it
adapts to the stress, but only if the stress is designed properly. You
wouldn’t lay out for 2 minutes and assume that it would make you brown,
because 2 minutes isn’t enough stress to cause an adaptation. Likewise,
only a stupid kid lays out for an hour on each side the first day,
because the stress is so overwhelmingly damaging that it cannot be
recovered from in a constructive way. Lots and lots of people come into
the gym and bench 225 every Monday and Friday for years, never even
attempting to increase the weight, sets, reps, speed, or pace between
sets. Some people don’t care, but some are genuinely puzzled that their
bench doesn’t go up, even though they have not asked it to. And some
people bench press once every three or four weeks, or maybe even more
rarely than that, using some arbitrary number like their own bodyweight
for 10 reps, then 9, then 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and finally 1 rep, and
wonder why their bench doesn’t go up, and also wonder why they’re so
damned sore all the time.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Your bench press strength doesn’t adapt
to the total number of times you’ve been to the gym to bench or to your
sincerest hope that it will get stronger. It adapts to the stress
imposed on it by the work done with the barbell. Furthermore, it adapts
to </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">exactly</span></span></span><span> the kind of stress
imposed on it. If you do sets of 20, you get good at doing 20s. If you
do heavy singles, you get better at doing those. But singles and 20s are
very different; the muscles and nervous system function differently when
doing these two things, and they require two different sets of
physiological capacities, and thus cause the body to adapt differently.
The adaptation occurs in response to the stress, and </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">specifically</span></span></span><span> to that stress,
because the stress is what causes the adaptation. This is why calluses
form where the bar rubs on the hand, and not on the other parts of the
hand, or on your face, or all over your body. It can obviously be no
other way. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Furthermore, the stress must be capable
of being recovered from. Unlike the 2 hours of sun the first day or the
55 bench reps once a month, the stress must be appropriate for the
trainee receiving it. If the stress is so overwhelming that you cannot
recover from it in time to apply more of it in a timeframe which permits
accumulated adaptation, it is useless as a beneficial tool that drives
progress. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>An awareness of this central organizing
principle of physiology as it applies to physical activity is essential
to program design. </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="bold">Exercise and training are two different
things.</span></span></span><span> </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">Exercise</span></span></span><span> is physical activity
for its own sake, a workout done for the effect it produces today,
during the workout or right after you’re through. </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">Training</span></span></span><span> is physical activity
done with a longer-term goal in mind, the constituent workouts of which
are specifically designed to achieve that goal. If a program of physical
activity is not designed to get you stronger or faster or better
conditioned by producing a specific stress to which a specific desirable
adaptation can occur, you don’t get to call it training. It is just
exercise. For most people, exercise is perfectly adequate – it’s
certainly better than sitting on your ass. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>But for athletes, an improvement in
strength provides more improvement in performance than any other
adaptation does, especially if the athlete is not already very strong.
Strength is the basis of athletic ability. If you are a good athlete,
you are stronger than a less-good athlete at the same level of skill. If
you want to be a better athlete, you get stronger. If you are already
very strong, you need to devote most of your attention to the
development of other aspects of performance. But there is a very high
likelihood that you are not that strong, since most people are not. You
may think you’re very strong, but really, you know you could get
stronger, don’t you? Sure you do. You may have convinced everybody else
that you’re strong enough; you may even be convinced of this yourself.
Your coach may have told you so, too. This deception is not productive,
though, because if you can get stronger, you should do so, and a lack of
strength may be why you’re not performing as well as you know you should
be. If your progress is stuck, and has been for a while, get stronger
and see what happens. And for a strength training program to actually
work, you must do something that requires that you be stronger to get it
done, and this requirement must be inherent in the program design.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The less experienced the athlete, the
simpler the program should be, and the more advanced the athlete, the
more complex the program must be. We are going to take advantage of a
phenomenon I have called the “Novice Effect.” Simply described, this is
what happens when a previously untrained person begins to lift weights –
he gets stronger very quickly at first, and then improves less and less
rapidly as he gets stronger and stronger. It is nothing more than the
commonly observed principle of diminishing returns, applied to adaptive
physiology. Rank novices are not strong enough to tax themselves beyond
their ability to recover, because they are so thoroughly unadapted to
stress; they have made almost no progress on the road to the fulfillment
of their athletic potential, and almost anything they do that is not
heinous abuse will cause an adaptation. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>When an untrained person starts an
exercise program, he gets stronger. He always does, no matter what the
program is. He gets stronger because anything he does that is physically
harder than what he’s been doing constitutes a stress to which he is not
adapted, and adaptation will thus occur if he provides for recovery. And
this stress will always produce more strength, because that is the most
basic physical adaptation to any physical stress that requires the body
to produce force. For a rank novice trainee, riding a bicycle will make
his bench press increase – for a short time. This does not mean that
cycling is a good program for the bench press; it just means that for an
utterly unadapted person, the cycling served as an adaptive stimulus.
The problem with cycling for a novice bench-presser is that it rapidly
loses its ability to act as an efficient enough </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">systemic</span></span></span><span> force-production
stress to continue driving improvement on the bench, since it does not
produce a force-production stress </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">specific</span></span></span><span> to the bench press.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The thing that differentiates a good
program from a less-good program is its ability to continue stimulating
the desired adaptation. So, by definition, a program that requires a
regular increase in some aspect of its stress is an effective program
for a novice, and one that doesn’t is less effective. For a novice, any
program is better than no program at all, so all programs work with
varying degrees of efficiency. This is why everybody thinks
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">their</span></span></span><span> program works, and why
you’ll always find perfectly honest testimonials for every new exercise
program on TV or the Internet. But nothing works as well as moderately
increasing some loading parameter each time, for as long as an
adaptation to the increase continues to occur, because it is
specifically designed to produce both stress and
adaptation.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>And since the best way to produce
athletic improvement in novices is to increase strength, a program that
increases total-body strength in a linear fashion is the best one for a
novice athlete to use if he is to improve his performance the most in
the shortest time possible. It seems rather apparent that there can be
only one efficient way to program barbell training for a novice, and
that is to apply a linear increase in force-production stress while
using basic exercises that work the whole body. If applied in a way that
can be supported by adequate recovery from the stress in a timeframe
that efficiently produces progress, this approach </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">always</span></span></span><span>
produces a linear increase in strength because it takes advantage of the
most basic rule of biology: organisms adapt to their environment if the
stress causes an adaptation and if the stress is not overwhelming in its
magnitude.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Rank novices can be trained close to the
limit of their ability every time they train, precisely because that
ability is at such a low level relative to their genetic potential. As a
result of this relatively hard training, novices get strong very
quickly. (Novices can recover from relatively hard training because they
are weak, and the training is not really that hard in absolute terms.)
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">Weak people
can obviously get stronger faster than strong people
can.</span></span></span><span> But that changes rapidly, and as you
progress through your training career, your program should get more and
more complicated as a result of the changing nature of your adaptive
response. The intermediate trainee has advanced to the point where the
stress required for change is high enough that when that stress is
applied in consecutive workouts, it exceeds the trainee’s capacity for
recovery within that period of time. Intermediate trainees are capable
of training hard enough that some allowances for active recovery must be
incorporated into the training program, but progress still comes faster
for these athletes when they are challenged often by maximum efforts.
Advanced athletes are working at levels close enough to their genetic
potential that great care should be taken to ensure enough variability
in the intensity and volume that overtraining does not become a problem.

<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>So, as a general rule, you need to try
to add weight to the work sets of the exercise every time you train,
until you can’t do this anymore. This is the basic tenet of “progressive
resistance training,” and setting up the program this way is what makes
it different from exercise. For as long as possible, make sure that you
lift a little more weight each time. Everyone can do this for a while,
and some can do it for longer than others, depending on individual
genetic capability, diet, and rest. If you are challenged, you will
adapt, and if you are not, you won’t. Training makes the challenge a
scheduled event instead of an accident of mood or whim, and certainly
not a random occurrence within an exercise program. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Before you even get through the door of
the weight room, you should already know every single thing you will do
while you are there, the order in which you will do it, how much weight
you will do it with, and how to determine the next workout based on what
you do today. No one should ever arrive to train not knowing exactly
what to do. Wandering around the gym, deciding what looks fun, doing it
until the fun stops, and then doing something else is not training. Each
training session must have a definite achievable goal, usually an
increase over the previous workout in the amount of weight lifted, or
another definable objective based on the person’s training
history.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Strength in each exercise will progress
differently, due to differences in the amount of muscle mass involved
and in the sensitivity of the movement to technique problems. The more
muscle mass involved in an exercise, the faster the exercise can get
strong and the stronger it has the potential to be. The deadlift, for
instance, improves rather quickly for most people, faster than any of
the other lifts, due to its limited range of motion around the hips and
knees and the fact that so many muscles are involved in the lift. In
contrast, the press goes up rather slowly due to the smaller muscles of
the shoulder girdle, while the shorter kinetic chain of the bench press
allows it to progress faster than the press. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>In a trained athlete, the deadlift will
be stronger than the squat, the squat stronger than the bench press, the
bench press and the power clean close to each other (with the bench
usually a little stronger), and the press lighter than the other four.
This distribution holds for the majority of athletes and is predictive
of what should happen. For example, if you bench more than you deadlift,
something is out of whack. You may have a grip problem, an injury, or a
motivational discontinuity, e.g., a strong dislike for the deadlift. In
any case, this situation should be addressed lest a strength imbalance
cause problems for other lifts. The differences in the nature of the
lifts must be considered in all aspects of their use in the weight room.

In order from left to right, strongest to weakest, the continuum of
potential strength gains for the basic barbell exercises for the early
part of the typical trainee’s career. The deadlift, squat, bench press,
and press actively involve decreasing amounts of muscle mass. Other
factors affect the power clean; although it involves a large amount of
muscle mass, the technical requirements of the lift place it somewhere
between the bench press and the press in strength and improvement
potential.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Learning the
Lifts</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Learn the squat first because it is the
most important exercise in the program and its skills are critical to
all the other movements. When you begin this program, if you have been
taught the movement incorrectly, you will have to unlearn it (the
worst-case scenario); if you have never been shown the movement, it will
be easier to learn because you won’t have incorrect motor pathways to
fix (the best-case scenario). It is much harder to correct an embedded
movement pattern than it is to learn a new one, as any sports coach will
attest. The problem is particularly evident in the weight room, where
correct technique is the essence of everything we do, and a stubborn
form problem resulting from prior incorrect instruction can be costly in
terms of time and slowed progress. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Assuming that you have time to learn
more than one exercise the first day (and you should arrange things so
that you do), the next exercise will be the press. The squat has
fatigued the lower body, and the press gives it an opportunity to rest
while another skill is introduced. The press is usually easy to learn
because of the absence of preconceived notions acquired from pictures in
the muscle magazines or from helpful buddies. Since the press is
relatively unfamiliar to most people these days, it makes a good
first-day upper-body exercise, grabbing your attention so that you know
we’re actually doing something different in the weight room this time
around. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span> The deadlift will be the last thing to
learn the first day. The deadlift is where you learn to set the lower
back, and doing this at the conclusion of the first day, after the
squat, will solidify the concept of back position and make it more
understandable to your body and your mind. The mechanics of the correct
pull from the floor are crucial to the clean, and the deadlift serves as
the best introduction to the idea that pulling from the floor is not
complicated. If the squat that first day has been difficult or has taken
a long time, or if you are older or very deconditioned, the first
deadlift workout might just be an introduction with light weight, and no
attempt to go to a heavy work set. Going light prevents excessive
soreness after the first session, which would definitely compromise the
second one. The next deadlift workout can be heavier, and the target
weight more easily and accurately determined, after you have recovered
from the first squat workout. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>You will learn the other two lifts at
the next workout, provided that you encountered no major problems. Start
the second workout with the squat, and then learn the bench press. Your
shoulders and arms may be tired from the press, but this will have
little effect on the bench press, a stronger movement anyway. The bench
press provides the same break for the lower body between exercises that
the press does, and you will need this break because you will be power
cleaning next.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The power clean, being the most
technically challenging of the exercises, should be introduced last, and
only after the deadlift is correct off the floor. If that occurs in the
first workout, you can learn the clean in the second workout. If you
need more time to correct the deadlift, take it. Introducing the power
clean too early will produce problems, since the bottom part of the
movement depends on the deadlift’s being fairly automatic.

<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>For novices, and in fact for most
advanced trainees, a very simple approach to training should be taken.
Effective workouts need not be long, complicated affairs. Many people
are under the impression that progress in the weight room means learning
more ways to curl, the basic one or two not being sufficient. But
progress means more </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">strength</span></span></span><span>, not more exercises;
the variable we manipulate is load, not exercise selection. You do not
need to do many different exercises to get strong – you need to get
strong on a very few important exercises, movements that train the whole
body as a system, not as a collection of separate body parts. The
problem with the programs advocated by all the national exercise
organizations is that they fail to recognize this basic principle: the
body best adapts </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">as a whole organism</span></span></span><span> to stress
applied to the whole organism. The more stress that can be applied
to</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic"> as much of
the body at one time </span></span></span><span>as possible, the more
effective and productive the adaptation will be. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>For a rank novice, the simplest of
workouts is in order. This short program can be followed for the first
few workouts:</span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><img src="./images/00674.jpg"
class="calibre8" /></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The two workouts alternate across the
MWF schedule for the first couple of weeks, until the freshness of the
deadlift has worn off a little and after the quick initial gains
establish the deadlift well ahead of the squat. At this point the power
clean is introduced:</span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><img src="./images/00675.jpg"
class="calibre8" /></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>After the first couple of weeks, you
squat every workout and alternate the bench press and press, and the
deadlift and power clean. This schedule is for three days per week,
allowing a two-day rest at the end of the week. It will mean that one
week you press and deadlift twice, and the next week you bench and power
clean twice. Do the exercises in the listed order, with squats first,
the upper-body movement second, and the pulling movement third. This
sequence allows the squat to get everything warm for the next exercise
(it does this well); then the upper-body exercise allows the legs and
back to rest and recover for the pulling movement to be done next.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>For most people, and for quite some
time, this schedule will work well. After two or three more weeks,
chin-ups can be added as the only really useful assistance exercise at
this point in the program. You might decide to add three sets of chins
after your power cleans, and stay with this program for as many months
as possible. Or, back extensions or glute/ham raises can be added in
place of pulling every workout, dropping the deadlift frequency to every
fifth workout, alternated with power cleans. This might be necessary if
recovery is becoming a problem, as it might be for an older trainee, a
female trainee, or someone who just refuses to eat and sleep enough. Now
the program looks like this:</span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><img src="./images/00676.jpg"
class="calibre8" /></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>This makes the next two weeks look like
this:</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><img src="./images/00677.jpg"
class="calibre8" /></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Any supplemental exercises other than
chin-ups should be chosen </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">very carefully</span></span></span><span> so as not to
interfere with progress on these five crucial movements. Remember: if
progress is being made on the primary exercises, you are getting
stronger and your objective is being accomplished. If in doubt, leave it
out. Ha.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>After you progress beyond the novice
phase, you can still use this workout, with very few additions. The
variety is introduced into the programming of each lift, and variations
are made in the workload. Even for more advanced trainees, it is
unnecessary to add lots of different exercises to the workout, as the
purpose is always served when strength levels increase on the basic
lifts. Any assistance exercises that are added must be kept in their
proper perspective; they are there to help you get stronger in the basic
lifts, not as an end in themselves. The press and the bench press, for
example, will always be more important than arm work, and if curls and
triceps exercises interfere with your recovery from pressing or
benching, instead of adding to your strength in these lifts, they are
being misused.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Most Olympic weightlifting coaches will
use a workout order that places faster movements before slower
movements, so that the explosive lifts – the snatch, the clean and jerk,
and their variations – are performed before the strength exercises, like
the squat and the pressing movements. This order makes sense if the
competitive lifts are the emphasis of the program, even though some of
the most competitive nations in Olympic weightlifting don’t always do it
this way. Our program uses the power clean as the explosive movement,
but since none of the exercises in this novice program are approached as
competitive lifts, doing the power clean as the last exercise in the
workout is more productive for strength development because it leaves
the emphasis on the squat. Doing the squat first provides a superior
warm-up for all the subsequent movements, and doing the squat while
you’re fresh grants it the attention it deserves as the most important
exercise in the program.</span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Warm-up
sets</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Warm-ups serve two very important
purposes. First, warm-ups actually make the soft tissue – the muscles
and tendons, and the ligaments that comprise the joints – warmer.
General warm-up exercises increase the temperature in the soft tissue
and mobilize the synovial fluid in the joints. These exercises include
walking fast or jogging, riding an exercise bike (a better method, due
to the greater range of motion the knees are exposed to during the
exercise, better preparing them for the squat), or using a rowing
machine (the best method, due to its range of motion and the full
involvement of the back and arms as well as the legs). Specific
warm-ups, like the empty-bar sets of the barbell exercise itself, also
serve to warm, mobilize, and stretch the specific tissues involved in
that particular movement. This step is important for injury prevention,
since it is more difficult to injure a warm body than a cold one.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The elevation of tissue temperature is
very important and requires that several variables be kept in mind. The
temperature of the training facility should be considered as a factor in
this phase of warm-up. A cold room interferes with effective warm-up,
while a hot room aids it. Winter months and summer months produce
different warm-up requirements for most athletes, who will usually
arrive at training feeling different in August than they do in January.
A healing injury needs extra warm-up for the affected tissues. And the
age of the trainee affects warm-up requirements as well. Younger people
are less sensitive to a lack of warm-up than adults are, and the older
the adult, the more time is needed for pre-workout preparation.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The second function of warm-ups is
especially important in barbell training: it allows you to practice the
movement before the weight gets heavy. Light warm-up sets, done first
with the empty bar and then progressively heavier until the work sets
are loaded, prepare the movement pattern itself so that when the weight
gets heavy, you can focus your attention on pushing hard instead of
worrying about how to push. The </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">motor
pathway</span></span></span><span> – the neuromuscular adaptation to a
complicated movement pattern – must be prepared every time it is used,
whether you’re throwing a baseball or doing a squat. The more familiar
the movement pattern, the less critical this aspect of warm-up becomes,
but for a novice it is always very important. The warm-up sets prepare
the motor pathway at the same time that they prepare the tissues for the
upcoming heavier work. While you are doing the first sets, you can
address and fix form errors so that during your work sets, you can focus
more on driving the load and less on maintaining correct
form.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>It is foolishness to neglect warm-ups.
Many government school programs, in an attempt to implement a strength
program without allotting sufficient time to do it, omit most of this
crucial part of the workout. The coach in charge of a program that does
this commits </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="bold">malpractice</span></span></span><span>. Please heed the
following rather strong statement: if your schedule does not allow time
for proper warm-up, </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">it does not allow time for training at
all</span></span></span><span>. It is better to omit strength training
from your program than to suffer the inevitable injuries that will
result from lack of warm-up. Yes, warm-ups are that
critical.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Warm-ups will vary with the lift being
warmed up. If the room is cold, an initial warm-up on a rower or
exercise bike might be useful to raise overall body temperature; if the
room is warm, this will probably not be necessary. The squat, by its
nature a total-body movement and being the first exercise of the
workout, serves quite well as its own warm-up. It should be carefully
and thoroughly prepared with a couple of empty-bar sets, and then as
many as five sets between those and the work sets. The next upper-body
movement will benefit from this preparation and, in the absence of an
injury, can be warmed up adequately with only three or four sets. The
deadlift will be warm from the squat, provided that the pressing hasn’t
taken so long that you have gotten cold. The power clean, being a more
complex movement, will require more warm-up for technique purposes.
Assistance exercises, if they are done, will be done last with already
warm muscles and joints, and will require only one or two warm-up sets.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Any area that is injured will require
additional warming up. If the injured area does not respond to the
warm-up sets by starting to feel much better after you do two or three
sets with the empty bar, you will have to decide whether to continue
with light sets or wait until the area has healed better.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>First, some terminology clarification. A
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">work
set</span></span></span><span> is the heaviest weight to be done in a
given workout, the sets that actually produce the stress which causes
the adaptation. </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">Warm-ups</span></span></span><span> are the lighter sets
done before the work sets. “Sets across” refers to multiple work sets
done with the same weight. The work sets are the ones that provide the
training effect; they are the sets that make strength go up, since they
are the heaviest – for novices, the weight you haven’t done before. The
warm-up sets serve only to prepare the lifter for the work sets; they
should never interfere with the work sets. So plan your warm-up sets
with this principle in mind. The last warm-up set should never be so
heavy that it interferes with the work sets, but it must be heavy enough
to allow you to feel some actual weight before you do the work sets. It
might consist of only one or two reps even though the work sets will be
five or more reps. For instance, if the work sets are to be 225 x 5 x 3
(three sets of five reps at 225 pounds), then 215 x 5 (five reps at 215)
would not be an efficient choice for a last warm-up; a better choice
would be 205 x 2, or even 195 x 1, depending on your preference, skill,
and experience. Since the focus is on completing all the reps of the
work sets, the warm-ups must be chosen to save gas for the heavier sets,
while still being heavy enough that the first work set is not a
shock.</span></span></p>
<br />
<br />
<span class="calibre1"></span>
<p><span class="calibre7"><img src="./images/00678.jpg"
class="calibre8" /></span></p>
<br />

<p><span class="small"><span><span class="bold"><span
class="italic">Table 8-1.</span></span></span><span> Example
distributions of warm-up sets and work sets. </span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>As an example of the importance of
proper warm-up, let’s examine the effects of a bad warm-up carried to
the extreme. There is an old workout, known as “The Pyramid,” still
floating around weight rooms and gyms all over the world. For the bench
press, this workout would go something like 135 x 10, 155 x 8, 175 x 6,
185 x 5, 195 x 4, 205 x 3, 215 x 2, and 225 x 1. By the time you finish
the last set, you might feel like you’ve had a pretty good workout. The
problem is that you have done 6390 pounds of work before getting to the
last set at 225, so your chances of ever increasing this last single are
slim. By the time you reach what should be a work set, you are all used
up, since all of your warm-up sets have essentially been work sets, too.
The warm-ups didn’t prepare you to increase your work sets, so you will
never lift any more weight than you did the last time you did this
workout, and you are therefore quite thoroughly stuck. If the warm-up
sets fatigue you instead of prepare you, they are not warm-ups and your
strength cannot increase.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>As a general rule, it is best to start
with an empty bar (“45” lb/20 kg), determine the work set or sets, and
then divide the difference between 45 pounds and the work-set weight
into even increments. Some examples are provided in Table 8-1. Most
people will need to select three to five warm-up sets, depending on the
work-set weight; extremely heavy weights may require more increments for
the trainee to get warm so that the jumps are not too big. If additional
warm-up is desirable (as with a cold room, older trainees, or injured
lifters), multiple sets can be done with the empty bar and the first
loaded set. This approach provides the benefits of the warm-up without
causing fatigue from doing too much work at heavier weight before the
work sets.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>As the warm-ups progress from the empty
bar up through heavier weights, the time between the sets should
increase a little. As a general rule, the time between sets should be
sufficient for you to recover from the previous set, so that fatigue
from the prior set does not limit the one you are about to do. The
heavier the set, the longer the break should be. This type of training
requires that all of the reps of each work set be completed, because the
program is based on lifting more weight each workout, not on completing
each workout or each exercise faster. A strength training program is
designed to make you stronger, i.e., able to exert more force and lift
more weight. Some training programs used in bodybuilding rely on the
accumulated fatigue produced by short breaks between sets, and these
programs specifically increase muscular endurance. Although endurance
increases as a function of strength, it is not a parameter specifically
targeted by our program at the novice level. You will benefit more by
lifting heavier weights, through the efficient timing of sets to allow
for recovery, than by trying to decrease the time between the sets and
thereby allowing fatigue to limit your ability to exert maximum
force.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The time between sets will vary, in a
couple of ways, with the conditioning level of the athlete. Rank novices
are not typically strong enough to fatigue themselves very much, and
they can go fairly quickly, just a minute or two, between sets, since
they are not lifting much weight anyway. The first two or three sets can
be done as fast as the bar can be loaded, especially if two or more
people are training together. More advanced trainees need more time,
perhaps 5 minutes, between the last warm-ups and the work sets. If
they’re doing sets across, very strong lifters may need 10 minutes or
more between work sets.</span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Work
sets</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The number of work sets to be done after
the warm-ups will vary with the exercise and the individual. The squat
benefits from sets across (three sets for novice trainees), as does the
bench press and the press. The deadlift is hard enough, and is usually
done after a lot of squatting, and one heavy set is usually sufficient,
with more tending to overtrain most people. The power clean can be done
with more sets across, since the weight is lighter relative to the squat
and deadlift, and the limiting factors are technique and explosive
power, not absolute strength. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Multiple work sets cause the body to
adapt to a larger volume of work, an adaptation that comes in handy for
those training for sports performance. One school of thought holds that
one work set, if done at a high enough intensity, is sufficient to
stimulate muscular growth. For novices, several problems with this
approach immediately present themselves. First, inexperienced trainees
do not yet know how to produce maximum intensity under the bar, and they
will not know how for quite some time. Second, if they don’t know how to
work at a very high intensity, more than one set will be needed to
accumulate sufficient stress to cause an adaptation to occur – one set
will not provide enough. Third and most important, one intense set
adapts the body to work hard for one intense set, since exercise, as we
know, is specific. It is true that strength is the most general athletic
adaptation, and the more force you can produce, the better. But for a
novice trainee, the context in which strength is produced is quite
important, and for the same reasons we don’t train novices with 1RM
work, we don’t use 2–5RM-level efforts either (to be discussed
immediately below). Except for sumo wrestling and a couple of others,
sports do not usually involve one isolated, relatively brief intense
effort, but generally involve repeated bouts of work. And one single set
at very high intensity is not the best way to build force-production
capacity if you lack the experience to effectively produce enough force
in one low-volume set. A sets-across routine more closely mimics the
effort usually involved in sports and more effectively allows the
trainee to learn to work hard, and therefore produces a more useful
adaptation.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>In fact, one of the most effective
strategies for intermediates is to do the squat, bench, and press for
five sets across of five reps, once a week as one of the three workouts,
increasing the weight used by very small manageable amounts each week.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The easiest way to stop your progress
between workouts is to fail to finish all the reps of all the prescribed
work sets. And the easiest way to make this happen is to fail to rest
long enough between work sets to allow fatigue from the previous set to
dissipate before you start the next set. If fatigue accumulates as the
work sets progress, the predictable outcome will be that instead of
5-5-5 reps, you will do 5-4-3 when 5-5-5 was actually possible had you
waited long enough between sets. This is the most common error made by
novice trainees: the confusion of strength training with conditioning
work. The program requires that you increase weight every workout for as
long as possible, and if you fail to complete all the reps of all the
work sets, you cannot increase the weight in your next workout. Make
sure you give yourself enough time to complete your reps. If the weight
is actually too heavy – because you took too big a jump or you have not
recovered from the previous workout – then your programming must change.
But impatience is a poor reason to allow progress to come to a halt.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>How many reps should a work set consist
of? It depends on the adaptation desired. Five reps is a good number for
most purposes, but an understanding of the reasons for this is essential
so that special circumstances can be accommodated correctly.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>When you’re trying to understand the
nature of any given set of variables, it is often helpful to start with
the extremes, the limits of which can reveal things about the stuff in
the middle. In this case, let’s compare a one-rep max, or 1RM, squat to
a 20RM squat and look at the different physiological requirements for
doing each set. Credit for this explanation goes to Glenn Pendlay, from
a conversation that yielded perhaps the most useful model of adaptation
to exercise ever developed.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The single most important contributing
factor to the successful heavy one-rep attempt is the ability of the
muscles involved to produce force. The heavier the weight, the more
force required to move it, as should be obvious. The one-rep set doesn’t
take very long to do, so muscular endurance is not a factor, and neither
is cardiovascular capacity, for the same reason. Even a bone-on-bone
limit attempt doesn’t take more than a few seconds. The only thing the
muscles must do is produce sufficient force to overcome the weight on
the bar as it moves through the range of motion of the lift one time.
So, in response to 1RM training, the body adapts by getting better at
producing high amounts of force, one rep at a time. It does this by
adjusting the components of the system that produce the force: the
nervous system, the neuromuscular system, and the muscles themselves,
specifically the components of the muscle that actually produce the
contraction. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>There are other adaptations that are
secondary to the main ones, but they all involve helping the body
perform a brief, intense effort. Psychological adaptations enable the
lifter to overcome his fear of a heavy weight. The heart adapts by
getting better at working with a huge load on the back, and the blood
vessels adapt by becoming capable of responding to the demands of
increased peak blood pressure. The tendons thicken to better transmit
force, and the ligaments thicken and tighten to hold the joints together
under the load. The skin under the bar gets thicker, the eyeballs get
used to bugging out, and new words are learned that express the emotions
accompanying success or failure with a new PR squat. But the primary
adaptation is increased force production.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>On the other hand, a heavy set of 20
reps is an entirely different experience, one of the most demanding in
sports conditioning. A set of 20 squats can usually be done with a
weight previously assumed to be a 10RM, given the correct mental
preparation and a certain suicidal desire to either grow or die. The
demands of a 20RM, and therefore the adaptation to it, are completely
different. A 20RM is done with about 80% of the weight of a 1RM, and
even the last rep is not really heavy, in terms of the amount of force
necessary to squat it. The hard part of a set of 20 is that the last 5
reps are done in a state resembling a hellish nightmare: making yourself
squat another rep with the pain from the falling muscle pH, an inability
to catch your breath, and the inability of your heart to beat any faster
than it already is. The demands of a 20RM involve continued muscle
contraction under circumstances of increasing oxygen debt and metabolic
depletion. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>In response to this type of stress, the
body gets better at responding to the high metabolic demand that is
created. Systemic adaptations are primarily cardiovascular in nature,
since the main source of stress involves managing blood flow and oxygen
supply during and after the set. The heart gets better at pumping blood
under a load, the vessels expand and become more numerous, and the lungs
get better at oxygenating the blood – although not in the same way that
a runner’s lungs do. The main muscular adaptations are those that
support local metabolism during the effort. Glycolytic capacity
increases. The contractile part of the muscle tissue gets better at
working under the acidic conditions produced by the stress of the long
work set. Psychologically, 20RM work is very hard, due to the pain, and
lifters who are good at it develop the ability to displace themselves
from the situation during the set. Or they just get very tough.

Sets of 5 reps are optimal for learning barbell exercises. It is
apparent from electromyography (EMG, a recording of neuromuscular
electrical activity, top) and force plate data (a measure of muscular
force generated, bottom) that there is a progressive loss of motor
coordination as reps increase. In reps 1–5, the muscle is firing in a
coordinated manner, with tight, uniform EMG waves and consistent force
production. By reps 10–14, there is a loss of motor coordination, with
erratic EMG wave and force continuity. By reps 25–29, EMG activity is
highly random and force production has deteriorated. Using more than 5
reps per set during the learning phase of a new exercise will usually
make correct technique harder to reproduce and master. Note that the
peak level of force production is the same on rep 1 and rep 20, although
control has begun to degrade; a 20-rep set is not really “heavy,” but it
sure is long and hard. </span></span></span></p>

The metabolic speedometer. How hard and how long we exercise directly
affects which metabolic pathways our bodies primarily use to fuel the
activity. All physical activity lies along a continuum, from rest to
all-out maximal effort. All activities are powered by the ATP already
present in the muscle, and all bioenergetic activity acts to replenish
these stores. Low-intensity exercise depends on cardiopulmonary delivery
and muscular uptake of oxygen, the ready availability of which enables
the body to use aerobic pathways and fatty acids as substrate. These
aerobic processes take place inside the mitochondria within the muscle
cells. As activity levels and energy requirements increase, the ability
of oxidative metabolism to meet the increased demand for ATP is
exceeded. Weight training and other forms of high-intensity training
exist at the anaerobic end of the continuum, using substrate that does
not require added O2. The diagram above represents the relationships
between the energy substrates and the metabolic pathways in which they
are used in different types of exercise. With the exception of
short-duration all-out maximal efforts, no activity uses only one
metabolic pathway, so the illustration above represents a sliding scale
of continually increasing intensity of activity.
</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>It is essential to understand that the
1RM work does not produce the conditioning stress that the 20RM work
does, and that the long set of 20 reps is not heavy in the same way that
the 1RM is. They are both hard, but for different reasons. Because they
are so completely different, they cause the body to adapt in two
completely different ways. These extremes represent a continuum, with a
heavy set of 3 more closely resembling 1RM in its adaptation, and a set
of 10 sharing more of the characteristics of a 20RM. Sets of five reps
are a very effective compromise for the novice, and even for the
advanced lifter more interested in strength than in muscular endurance.
They allow enough weight to be used that force production must increase,
but they are not so heavy that the cardiovascular component is
completely absent from the exercise. Sets of five may be the most useful
rep range you will use over your entire training career, and as long as
you lift weights, sets of five will be important. </span></span></p>

<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The effective training of novices takes
advantage of the fact that untrained people get strong very quickly at
first, and this effect tapers off over time until advanced trainees, who
are already strong, gain more strength only by carefully manipulating
all training variables. Novices can and should increase the weight of
the work sets every workout until this is no longer possible. In fact,
novices get strong as fast as the workout makes them, and what was hard
last time is not hard today. They can adapt so quickly that the concept
of “maximum intensity” is hard to define. If a kid gets strong as fast
as his work sets increase, a 10-pound jump is not really heavier
relative to his improved strength. The key to maintaining this rate of
improvement is the careful selection of the amount of weight that you
increase each time.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Work-set weight increases will vary with
the exercise, your age and sex, your experience, and the consistency of
your adherence to the program. For most male trainees with good
technique, the squat can be increased 10 pounds per workout, assuming
three workouts per week for two to three weeks. When you miss the last
rep or two of your last work set, the easy gains are beginning to wane,
and you can take 5-pound jumps for several months; back up 5 pounds and
start with 5-pound jumps. For very young kids, older trainees, and most
women, 5-pound jumps are sufficient to start with, and then smaller
jumps will be required, as will the lighter barbell plates (lighter than
the standard 2½ lb plates) that make smaller jumps possible.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>If it is important for women and kids to
make progress – and why would it not be? – it is important to have the
right equipment to train them correctly. You might need to make the
plates out of 2-inch flat washers, or have some 2½ lb plates milled
down, but it is obviously necessary, so get it done. Small plates are
available from various sources on the Web, and baseball bat weights will
usually fit the bar quite well. It will be useful at some point for
everybody to have access to light plates, since progress on the lifts
will eventually slow to the point where they will be useful even for
advanced men. Don’t be afraid to take small jumps – instead, do be
afraid to stop improving. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Some very genetically gifted, heavier
men can take bigger jumps of 15 or 20 pounds for the first two weeks.
Anything more than this is usually excessive, even for the most gifted
athlete, since an increase of 60 pounds per week in the squat is not
going to be realistically sustainable for very long. Don’t be in a big
hurry to find your sticking point early in your training progression. It
is always preferable to take smaller jumps and sustain the progress than
to take bigger jumps and get stuck early. Getting stuck means missing
any of the reps of the prescribed work sets, since the weight cannot be
increased until all of the reps have been done as prescribed.
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="bold">It is easier to
not get stuck than it is to get unstuck.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>In the bench press, the muscles used are
smaller, so the increases will be smaller. If the first workout has
properly determined their initial strength level, most men can do
5-pound jumps for a while, perhaps three to four weeks, if they are
alternating bench presses and presses. Some talented, heavier men can
make a few 10-pound jumps, but not many. Older guys, the very young, and
women will need to start with small jumps, and the special light plates
are particularly important for these trainees to keep making progress on
the bench. Do not be afraid to slow the increases down to very small
jumps on the bench; remember that an increase of even 2 pounds per week
means a 104-pound increase in a year, not a shameful amount of progress
for the bench press.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The press will behave similarly to the
bench press, since the muscles involved in moving the bar are small
relative to the squatting and deadlifting muscles. The press uses lots
of muscles, true, but the limiting factors are the strength and the
efficiency of the mechanics of the smaller upper-body muscles, and no
chain is stronger than its weakest link, as the saying goes. The same
jumps used for the bench can usually be used for the press, although the
press will start off at somewhere between 50% to 70% of the weight used
in the bench press. Since you are alternating the two exercises, they
will stay about the same weight apart as they
increase.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The deadlift will progress faster than
any of the other lifts, because the start position, basically a
half-squat or above, is very efficient mechanically, and because
virtually every muscle in the body is involved in the movement. Most men
can add 15 pounds to the deadlift each workout for a couple of weeks,
with the very young, women, and older guys taking a more conservative
approach. But 5-pound jumps in the deadlift should be sustainable for
several months. This being the case, the deadlift will start out with
heavier weights than the other lifts for all trainees, should get
stronger faster, and will continue to be stronger than the other lifts
(unless you become an advanced powerlifting competitor). A trainee who
benches more than he deadlifts needs to stop avoiding his deadlift
workouts. But since the deadlift involves more muscles and more weight
than the other lifts, it is easier to overtrain. </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="bold">For a
novice,</span></span></span><span> </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="bold">the deadlift should not be trained
using sets across.</span></span></span><span> It is really easy to get
really beat-up doing a lot of heavy deadlifts. One work set at the
intensity of a real work set is quite sufficient to produce improvement.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>It is interesting that the power clean
behaves more like the bench press than like the squat or deadlift, in
terms of the way it increases over time. The reason for this involves
the biomechanical nature of the movement and the factors limiting its
progress. The power clean is explosive and technical, and it involves
more than just absolute strength. It is limited at the top of the
movement by the lifter’s ability to get the bar on the shoulders, and
the heavier the weight, the more the power clean depends on the lifter’s
ability to generate enough momentum to get the bar high enough to rack.
This momentum is controlled by the lifter’s ability to explode – to
recruit lots of motor units into contraction instantly – a physical
attribute that is largely dependent on genetics and thus is less
responsive to training than strength is. The power clean will move up
maybe 5 pounds per workout for most men. If the power snatch is used, it
will also move up slowly for the same reasons, albeit with a lighter
weight than that used in the power clean. Women and younger, older, and
lighter trainees will need to introduce smaller plates earlier in the
progression.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Ancillary exercises, which are by their
nature inefficient isolation-type exercises, produce very slow progress.
Anybody claiming rapid gains on triceps extensions or barbell curls is
not utilizing particularly strict form and should be criticized for such
foolishness.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>When these smaller jumps can no longer
be sustained, a trainee can be considered an intermediate, and the fun
begins with more complicated manipulation of training variables. This
variation in exercises, tonnage, and intensity for the purpose of
ensuring continued progress is referred to as </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">periodization</span></span></span><span>. It is
unnecessary for rank beginners, since they get strong as fast as they
can increase the weight every workout, and it is indispensable for
advanced lifters, who cannot continue to make progress without it.
Intermediates are, like the name says, somewhere in between, with some
degree of training parameter manipulation necessary to allow for
continued but slower progress. Programming beyond the novice phase is
beyond the scope of this book and is dealt with in detail in
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">Practical
Programming for Strength Training, Second
Edition</span></span></span><span> (Aasgaard, 2009). </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>And all these guidelines apply only to
committed trainees who do not miss workouts. Failure to train as
scheduled is failure to follow the program, and if the program is not
followed, progress cannot predictably occur. If you have to miss a
couple of workouts due to severe illness, or possibly the death of a
parent, spouse, or good dog, allowances can be made, and the last
workout you completed should just be repeated set for set. But if you
continually miss workouts, you are not actually training, and your
obviously valuable time should be spent more productively
elsewhere.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Likewise, trying to increase the weight
faster than prescribed by the program and by common sense is also
failure to follow the program. If you insist on attempting unrealistic
increases between workouts, it is your fault when progress does not
occur. Ambition is useful, greed is not. Most of human history and the
science of economics demonstrate that the desire for more than is
currently possessed drives improvement, both personally and for
societies. But greed is an ugly thing when uncontrolled and untempered
with wisdom, and it will result in your program’s progress coming to an
ass-grinding halt. The exercises must increase in weight in order for
progress to occur, by definition. But if you allow yourself to succumb
to the temptation of 10-pound jumps on the bench press, or 50-pound
increases on the squat, just because the heavier plates were handy (or
the correct plates were inconvenient), you are going to get stuck. Too
much weight on the bar is just as bad as no increase in weight at all
or, for that matter, missing workouts. Take the time and care necessary
to ensure that the right weight gets on the bar and gets lifted the
right number of times the right way.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>It is understandable that you want your
program to show results. But please understand this, if you miss
everything else in this entire book: </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">stronger does not necessarily
mean more weight on the bar. </span></span></span><span>Resist the
temptation to add weight at the expense of correct technique – you are
doing no one any favors when you sacrifice form for weight on the bar.
Progress stops, bad habits get formed, injuries accumulate, and no one
benefits in the long run.</span></span></p>

<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>It is common to want what you cannot
have. But you must keep in mind that the phenomenon of cause and effect
cannot be argued with or circumvented by your wishes and desires.
Everyone who has been a kid or has raised kids is familiar with the
phenomenon of the “growth spurt,” which happens naturally during all
stages of normal development. Growth occurs sporadically as we develop
and mature; it is not smooth over the course of the whole
infant/child/adolescent/teenager continuum, but within the growth spurt
itself, a period of smooth linear increase does occur. We are creating
an artificial growth spurt with our training, and if the stress is
sufficient and the diet is adequate to facilitate recovery, amazing
progress can occur. This is why proximity in age to the normal growth
window makes for a more efficient response to this stimulus: the
processes by which growth is accomplished are still functioning, and the
system is not yet cemented in its final form. The older the trainee, the
further the remove from the capacity to generate a growth spurt. But the
stimulus/response relationship is axiomatic – you get out of it what you
put into it, within the context of your ability to respond. You maximize
this ability by training, eating, and resting in the most effective way
possible. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>A program of this nature tends to
produce the correct bodyweight in an athlete. That is, if you need to be
bigger, you will grow, and if you need to lose bodyfat, that happens,
too. It is possible, and quite likely, that skinny kids on this program
will gain 10–15 pounds of bodyweight in the first two weeks of a good
barbell training program, provided they eat well. “Well” means four or
so meals per day, based on meat and egg protein sources, with lots of
fruit and vegetables and lots of milk. Lots. Most sources within the
heavy-training community agree that a good starting place is one gram of
protein per pound of bodyweight per day, with the rest of the diet
making up 3500–6000 calories, depending on training requirements and
body composition. Although these numbers produce much eyebrow-raising
and cautionary statement-issuing from the registered-dietetics people,
it is a fact that these numbers work well for the vast majority of
people who lift weights, and these numbers have worked well for decades.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>One of the best ways to move in the
direction of these numbers is to drink a gallon of milk a day, most
especially if weight gain is a primary concern. A gallon of whole milk
per day, added to the regular diet at intervals throughout the day, will
put weight on any skinny kid. Really. The problem is getting them to do
it. It is apparently a persistent tendency, since about 1990, for boys
to think they need a “six pack,” although most of them don’t have an ice
chest to put it in. The psychology of this particular historical
phenomenon is best left to others to investigate and explain. Aesthetics
aside, heavier is eventually necessary if stronger is to occur, and once
most people see that weight gain actually makes them look better
(amazingly enough), they become less resistant to the idea.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Milk works because it is easy, it is
available, it doesn’t need any preparation, and it has all the
components necessary for growing mammals, which novice lifters most
definitely are. There also seems to be something special about milk that
the equivalent amount of calories, protein, fat, and carbs can’t
duplicate in terms of growth enhancement. It may be the fact that milk
has very high levels of </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">insulin-like growth factor 1</span></span></span><span>
(IGF-1), a peptide hormone that has been shown to have some relationship
to accelerated growth in mammals. But that research is far from
conclusive; suffice it to say that experience has shown that people who
drink lots of milk during their novice phase get bigger and stronger
than people who don’t. This time-proven method works for everybody who
can digest milk – though the truly lactose-intolerant might not be able
to take advantage of its benefits without supplementing with lactase,
the enzyme needed for the breakdown of this milk sugar. Most other
people are fine with a gallon per day if they start out with a quart and
work up over two weeks.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Weight gain occurs the same way strength
gains occur – fast at first, then more slowly as training progresses. It
is quite possible for genetically favored individuals – for example, a
broad-shouldered, motivated 5&amp;apos;10 kid, weighing 140 pounds – to
gain as much as 60 pounds in a year of good steady training, good diet,
and milk. This is actually not that unusual a result for this type of
trainee, although when it occurs, there will always be talk of steroids,
because this is human nature – as a general rule, anybody stronger than
you is taking steroids. What is unusual is finding a genetically gifted
athlete who will actually do the program – all of it. It is far more
common to see 20-pound increases in bodyweight over a four-month period,
with only a very few diligent trainees doing much better. But most guys
who will eat even a little better than they did before will gain several
pounds the first few weeks.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Fat guys (not used here disparagingly)
see a different result entirely, as their bodyweight doesn’t change much
for the first few months. What they notice is looser pants in the waist;
legs and hips staying about the same; shirts that are much tighter in
the chest, arms, and neck; and faster strength increases compared to
their skinny buddies. Their body composition changes while their
bodyweight stays close to the same, the result of a loss in bodyfat due
to their increasing muscle mass.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>So if you do the program as written, and
you are a novice male between the ages of 18 and 35 with a starting
bodyweight of 160–175 pounds, the first five or six squat workouts will
see the work sets going up 10 pounds every time. If your first day is
115 x 5 x 3 sets across, then 165 x 5 x 3 will be the sixth workout. A
novice in this demographic who is eating and resting correctly and who
is otherwise healthy will be able to do this. Eating correctly may mean
6000 calories/day, including a gallon of whole milk, or it may mean 3500
calories/day on a Paleo-type, lower-carb, no-dairy diet, depending on
your initial body composition. If this or its equivalent training result
did not happen, you’re not doing the program. During this period of
time, it is common to gain 5–10 pounds of bodyweight if you are
underweight, or to stay about the same if you are in need of bodyfat
loss. In this demographic, you’re too fat if you’re over 20% bodyfat and
underweight if you’re less than 10%. Bodyfat under </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">about</span></span></span><span>
10% is not usually the level that a performance athlete carries, and
growing a significant amount of muscle mass will entail an increase in
bodyfat. A bodyfat level over </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">about</span></span></span><span> 20% means that you’re
headed in the direction of carrying around more than is required for an
anabolic environment and more than is efficient for moving either the
bar or an opponent. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>It is potentially slipshod to assign an
underweight or overweight designation on the basis of bodyfat, but it
usually works pretty well, and in the absence of currently non-existent
height/weight/bodyfat tables that take all three variables into account,
it’s about the best we can do. It is true that many people who want or
need to gain bodyweight are also in love with their visible abs, and
will not appreciate the advice to increase bodyfat if they are below
10%. The fact is that the dietary habits necessary to sustain
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">about</span></span></span><span> 10% or lower
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">for most
people</span></span></span><span> is too low to sustain the metabolic
environment required for a novice to gain muscle mass. And 10% bodyfat –
if you do not have genetically low bodyfat (you know who you are) – is
not healthy; the conditions that are required to produce and maintain it
are not compatible with high strength and power performance levels; and
those levels are necessary to get big and strong. Or rather, strong and
thus big. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>This probably means you. Make up your
mind that at least for the first year or two, you’re not going to worry
about bodyfat levels if you’re already lean, because lean is easier to
reacquire than strong is to build. This current emphasis on being lean
at the expense of all other things is the direct result of Joe Weider’s
having done his job very well. You have seen pictures of big
bodybuilders at 6% bodyfat in contest shape so often that you think it’s
normal, desirable, and always possible. Don’t forget that there are
drugs involved, along with enough other odd dietary behavior that Mr.
Weider should be flogged for forgetting to mention that part. It would
be much better to become realistic about these things and to stop
letting the physique magazine and supplement industries make you
stupid.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>On the other hand, if you’re a little
fluffy around the belly, you have obviously already created the
conditions necessary for growth. You’ll usually start out stronger than
the skinny guy, and because your body hasn’t got the problems with
growing that skinny guys do, strength gains can come more easily for you
if you eat correctly. You’ll still eat a lot, but don’t drink the milk,
and cut your carb intake if you don’t see bodyfat levels drop during
these first couple of weeks. You’ll first notice that your pants fit
looser in the waist.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span> So, if you correctly chose the work-set
weight for your first workout and your squat didn’t go up 40–50 pounds
between the first and sixth workouts, either you’re not in that
demographic (a novice male between the ages of 18 and 35 with a starting
bodyweight of 160–175) or you’re not doing the program. If you’re one of
these guys who thinks you gained a lot of strength because your squat
went up 30 pounds in three months, you’re not doing the program (which I
shall henceforth abbreviate as YNDTP). If you think the program is hard
because your bodyweight at 5&amp;apos; 8" went from 148 down to 146 and
you got stuck on the third workout, with your squat having gone up 15
pounds, YNDTP. If you’re a fat guy who has decided to go on the Atkins
diet at the same time you started the novice progression, is continually
sore, and is stuck at 30 pounds of squat increase, YNDTP.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>After the first couple of weeks, the
increase of 10 pounds per workout becomes unsustainable and 5-pound
jumps become the rule. This jump provides for a long, steady linear
increase in strength that has the potential to go on for months. It
translates to a 15-pound-per-week increase in squat strength, half as
fast as the first two weeks but still very significant at about 60
pounds per month. This progression adds up to a 205–225 x 5 x 3 squat
workout after six or seven weeks of training for our novice male,
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="bold">if he has been
eating correctly. </span></span></span><span>And eating correctly is
part of the program. If he started the program at a bodyweight of 165,
he should probably weigh 185 at this point, more if he’s taller. If
you’re squatting 30 pounds more than you started, at six weeks into the
program, YNDTP. If you started at 5&amp;apos; 9" and 155, and six weeks
later you weigh 160, YNDTP. If you started at 5&amp;apos; 9" and 235,
and six weeks later you’re only squatting 50 pounds more than you
started with, still at a bodyweight of 235, YNDTP. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Realistically, gains on the squat will
slow after this period to an </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">average</span></span></span><span> of about 10 pounds per
week due to the fact that most people will get sick occasionally, miss a
workout or two because of school, work, family, etc., or get a minor
injury that will need to be dealt with. Ideally, these interruptions do
not occur, but you’ll find that in most cases, the extremely rapid
growth in strength and size experienced during the first six to eight
weeks is not sustained. But the program does not change, because 5-pound
jumps are theoretically possible for this entire novice period. The
bumps are dealt with on a case-by-case basis, and the diet is held
constant as long as things are improving predictably. This will
therefore usually mean that after 10–12 weeks on the program, another 40
pounds has been added to the squat, resulting in about 245–265 x 5 x 3
for our generalized guy’s squat. During this period, your bodyweight
should be continuing to increase if you’re the skinny guy, or your
bodyfat should be continuing to moderate if you were the fat guy. Skinny
guys by now have added perhaps 40 pounds, and fat guys might have
started to actually gain bodyweight after the initial loss, depending on
how fat they were when they started. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>So, if you’re three months into the
program and your squat has gone up 50 pounds, YNDTP. If you’re three
months into the program at 10% bodyfat and you have gained only 6
pounds, YNDTP. If you’re three months into the program at 30% bodyfat,
your waistline has not gone down 4 inches, and your squat is not up at
least 150 pounds, YNDTP. Again, the program uses a diet that facilitates
progress, and not everybody will use the same diet to progress toward
the same goal of more muscle mass, since we don’t want to let bodyfat
get out of control. And out of control is not the same thing as a
moderate, necessary, healthy increase.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>After the first three or four months, a
change will be necessary for most guys who started off skinny. If you
have done the program correctly, you will have gained quite a bit of
weight, about 60% of it being lean body mass (LBM) – muscle, tendon, and
bone. This means that your bodyfat may have gone from ~10% to 18–19%.
This is fine; it was necessary to produce the LBM increase. But now it’s
time to modify the diet to reflect your body’s approach to its limit of
fast LBM growth. All improvement rates taper off; improvement obviously
can’t go on forever, but it must occur at first to get our goal
accomplished. Now, we need to drop the milk down to a half-gallon a day
for a while, and then perhaps less than that. At the same time, daily
caloric intake should drop to about 4000 calories/day, which you
accomplish by cleaning up the carb intake and focusing on dietary
quality instead of quantity like you did at first. This adjustment will
allow your bodyfat levels to drop back to where they need to be, in the
range of 15–17%, normal for athletic males in our demographic. The fat
guys should be approaching 20% by now as well, since their diet has been
about the same since the beginning; but their body</span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">weight</span></span></span><span>
should have started back up by now, as bodyfat loss has slowed and LBM
increases have begun to exceed the loss. In this way, the two extremes
converge at about the same dietary intake levels, with the guys who were
skinny maintaining a slightly higher caloric intake that reflects their
natural tendency toward being skinny. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Along with these changes have come
another 30–40 pounds of squat. The program has not changed
significantly, but the gains have begun to taper as the complexities of
life and adaptation have accumulated to further interfere with your good
intentions. But if you have persisted on the program and have not used
these tapering results as an excuse to drop it and move “on” to
super-slow, or HIT, or this year’s Pre-Olympia Contest Preparatory
Routine, you’ll still be accumulating progress. This will mean that your
squat may be up 200 pounds.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>So, if you’re still drinking a gallon of
milk a day eight months into the program, YNDTP. If you have gained only
8 pounds, either as a skinny guy or above your low point when you were
losing bodyfat, YNDTP. If your squat has increased only 50 pounds,
YNDTP.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Training drives strength acquisition,
the strength increase drives mass gain, and the mass gain facilitates
the strength increase. They are all intimately related, and they
approach a limit asymptotically. The younger you are, the steeper the
curve. You need a caloric and protein surplus, which will produce some
bodyfat accumulation that you can deal with later. The training stress
has to constantly increase by as much as you can tolerate every workout.
The variable is the load, not the number of exercises, sets, or reps.
The ability to tolerate a rapid increase in load and to continue to
quickly adapt slows after a few months. But during this period, don’t
waste your opportunity to grow quickly. After this, the program and diet
must change to reflect the reality of slower progress.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>A lot of money has been wasted on weight
rooms and gyms since the 1970s. Commercial exercise machines, as a
general rule, are expensive, single-purpose devices, delivering one
exercise per footprint on the floor at a very high price per square foot
of training space. Home gym equipment is usually multi-station, using
various elastic media to provide adjustable resistance for a variety of
silly exercises. Barbells, on the other hand, are cheap. They can be
used for lots of different exercises. The upright support bench for the
bench press, a single-purpose device, is not an absolutely necessary
piece of equipment, since the exercise we use it for can be done with a
flat bench and a power rack. All of the exercises in this program can be
done with a minimum of equipment, which allows for the better use of
resources. Instead of the hundreds of thousands of dollars spent on an
average 15-station circuit of machines, a third of that amount could be
spent on the best barbell room in the world, with bumper plates, good
bars, and platform space to accommodate lots of lifters, all in the same
space. At home, a good free-weight gym can be built in the garage with
brand new equipment for the price of three years’ gym dues. You may
decide to build your own gym, and the following guidelines can apply to
your garage or to any gym you might decide to join.</span></span></p>

<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The training facility should be
organized around the power rack. The rack should have a floor built into
it, and a platform attached to it, so that the inside floor of the rack
is perfectly flush with the surface of the platform. An 8&amp;apos; x
8&amp;apos; platform works well, providing plenty of room for every
purpose it will serve. The rack and platform unit will use about 96
square feet, and in this space, all the exercises in this program can be
performed. A bench press and bar assembly uses about 36 square feet if
this equipment is available separately. The layout of the room around
this equipment accommodate the amount of space needed for loading and
spotting the bars used on the stations. </span></span></p>

platform/rack/flat-bench station. All basic barbell exercises can be

<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The power rack is the most important
piece of equipment in the room, second only to the plate-loaded barbell
as the most useful piece of gym equipment ever invented. All five
primary exercises can be done with a correctly designed rack, barbell,
and flat bench. The rack should be wide enough between the uprights to
just safely accommodate the bar without a lot of extra room between the
sleeves and the uprights (about 48 inches). The wider the rack, within
safe limits, the more easily it can be safely used by taller, bigger
lifters, thus accommodating everyone. A 7½- to 8-foot-tall rack allows
the crossbar at the top to be used for chin-ups and pull-ups by tall
trainees. The depth of the rack may need to accommodate squatting inside
it occasionally; for most people, an inside dimension of 22 inches works
well and allows them to do dips inside the rack. The base depth should
be greater (about 36 inches) for tipping stability. The optimum setup is
to have the rack bolted to the floor at the corners so that pull-ups and
chin-ups can be done without tipping the rack if they happen to swing.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The rack should be fitted with a heavy
plywood floor, reinforced with a welded crossmember under the wood. The
floor will extend all the way to the front and rear edges of the rack
base so that it can be made flush and continuous with the platform
surface.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
There should be a hook assembly for the bar to hang from outside the
rack – my hook assemblies consist of two very large shoulder bolts with
stops welded on them about halfway down the bolt at the edge of the
unthreaded shoulder. Four heavy pins should cross the depth of the rack
from front to back, with 4 inches or so extra on each side. These pins
and hooks will adjust in height using the holes drilled in the channel
iron that forms the uprights of the rack. The closer together the holes
are, the finer the adjustments can be to accommodate lifters of various
heights; 3 inches center to center is good, but 4 inches does not work
well. The holes should extend from top to bottom. The entire rack should
be correctly welded together, with no bolted components to loosen.<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Plywood is the most commonly used
material for the platform. It is relatively cheap and very tough, and
six sheets make a perfect 8&amp;apos; x 8&amp;apos; platform. The layers
are alternated so that the seams do not penetrate the whole platform,
and the unit is made very strong when the layers are glued and screwed
together. Be sure to buy plywood without any void spaces in the layers,
because they WILL collapse if you drop a loaded barbell on top of them,
anywhere in the stack of layers. This means that you have to buy B-grade
or better, where all the knotholes are plugged. </span></span></p>

<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Particle board makes a very good, very
flat, solid hard surface with no void spaces, but it has some drawbacks.
It comes in 49" x 97" sheets, so it doesn’t overlap perfectly when three
layers are laid in alternate directions – the edges will be off by an
inch every two sheets. And even though the material is very smooth and
hard (the ¾" board feels like sheet concrete), it is extremely sensitive
to moisture; one leak anywhere around it and the whole platform is
useless. But if the room can be kept dry and you don’t mind ripping the
edges, particle board makes a damned good platform. It is even a little
cheaper than plywood, since A/B plywood is very pricey these days.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Rubber horse-trailer mats finish the
surface, making it virtually indestructible. These are available in farm
stores and vary in thickness from ½ to ¾ inch. These mats are important
to protect your platform and your plates when weights are dropped, which
will occur no matter your intentions. The thickness of the whole
platform assembly is about 3 inches, assuming ¾-inch plywood and ¾-inch
rubber (see example <a
href="#filepos521945"
class="calibre9">Figure 4-48</a>). The rack and the platform surface
need to be flush to eliminate the tripping hazard, and invariably either
the rack or the surface of the platform will need to be shimmed, since
racks and platforms usually won’t match. Shim the floor under the rack
with rubber, plywood, or some other dense, flat stuff to make the
dimensions agree, or use extra rubber on the platform or rack floor
surface. Custom platforms are available from several sources; these are
usually designed for the Olympic lifts and will be expensive but
good-looking. They are unnecessary, but nice if the budget permits.

benches</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>An upright support bench for the bench
press should be sturdy as hell, fully welded with no bolted joints to
loosen, and may or may not have adjustable hooks. If the hooks are not
adjustable, the fixed hook should be about 19 inches above the surface
of the bench. This equipment should always have wide uprights, about 48
inches apart, to minimize the risk of bar-loading imbalances and racking
accidents involving the hands. The surface of the bench will be 17
inches high with the padding compressed, 12 inches wide, and 48 inches
long. The feet of the bench should not interfere with your foot
placement; i.e., the bench feet should not be so wide that your feet
touch them. The bench should be built in such a way that it does not tip
back when heavy weights are racked hard. There should be no obstruction
for a center spotter standing at the bencher’s head. Some benches are
equipped with safety hooks, fixed below the top hooks, to give a stuck
solo bencher a way to get the bar off his chest without having to dump
it on the floor or wait till the First Responder arrives. If these
safety hooks are present, they should be right above chest height, about
9–10 inches above the bench. </span></span></p>

<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Most commercial gyms will have
bench-press benches, since having them frees up the power racks for
other exercises (assuming that the gym has power racks and knows how
they’re used for this purpose), but again, they are not actually
necessary since the power rack and a flat bench can be used for bench
presses. Your garage gym will not need anything but a flat bench, which
should have the same dimensions and simple construction as the support
bench without the uprights. Too much padding will increase the effective
height of the bench; that is not good for shorter lifters, annoying to
taller ones who have used proper equipment before, and bad for everybody
trying to get a firm plant against the bench. Too wide a bench is a bad
problem at the bottom of the movement, where it interferes with the
shoulders and arms as the bar touches the chest. </span></span></p>

class="calibre9">Figure 8-6</a>. The flat bench should be as sturdy as
an upright support bench.</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Most benches are upholstered with vinyl
for ease of cleaning. This material wipes off well, but fabric
upholstery lasts </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">many</span></span></span><span> times longer, especially
auto upholstery fabric. Fabric also provides better traction for the
back during lifting. Fabric can be cleaned with a wire brush and a
shop-vac, and stains can be removed with mineral spirits and a
rag.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Bars, plates, and
collars</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Bars are the place to spend money, if
you have it. If you don’t, raise it somehow, because cheap bars are
potentially dangerous, unpleasant to use, and a bad investment. Cheap
bars will bend. Even expensive bars can bend under the wrong
circumstances, if they are dropped loaded across a bench, for instance.
But cheap bars will always bend, even under normal use. Cheap bars
should be – but somehow never are – an embarrassment to their
manufacturers and the gyms that keep them. You can do better, and you
should.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Standard “Olympic” bars – the general
term for a bar with a 2-inch sleeve that accepts plates with a 2-inch
hole – should weigh 20 kilos or 44 pounds, within a tolerance of just a
few ounces. The tradition in the United States is to round the bar
weight up to 45 pounds since our plates have traditionally been
manufactured in pounds (even if the bars were actually 20 kg to satisfy
the competitive standards of the international barbell federations). The
weight on the bar will always be referred to as “135” even though it
actually weighs 134 pounds. Cheap bars are occasionally produced that
weigh below spec, so be careful, again, with cheap
bars.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>A good bar should be properly knurled
and marked, should be put together with roller pins or snap rings, not
bolts, and should require little maintenance beyond wiping it off
occasionally and putting a drop of oil on the bushings or bearings every
six months. It should be made to international competition specs, not
because you’ll be competing internationally (although you might) but so
that the sleeves will accommodate the different brands of plates that
all weight rooms eventually accumulate. Above all, a good bar is made of
excellent steel bar stock, which will not deform with normal use. Expect
to pay $250 or more for a good bar. There are lots of cheap imported
bars available for less than $150. They are junk. Do not buy them. And
do not hesitate to send back a good bar that bends under normal use,
since it is not supposed to do that. A reputable company will replace a
bar that fails, since their manufacturer will stand behind them in this
event. If they don’t, tell all your friends.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>All real weight rooms are equipped with
standard barbell plates with a 2-inch center hole. The little plates
with a 1-inch hole are referred to as “exercise plates,” and are not
useful since no good bar is commercially produced for them. Standard
barbell plates come in 2.5-, 5-, 10-, 25-, 35-, and 45-pound sizes. Of
these, all are necessary except the 35s. Any loading that involves a 35
can be done with a 25 and a 10, and the space saved on the plate racks
can be used for additional, more useful plates. Plates lighter than 2.5
pounds should be provided for use by women, kids, and everybody who
wants to maintain linear progress on the bench press and press. Lighter
plates can be made from 2-inch flat washers glued or taped together in
the appropriate groups. Metric plates are 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25,
and occasionally 45 kg, with lighter plates down to 0.5 kg used in
weightlifting competition. </span></span></p>

<br />

<p><span class="small"><span class="calibre7"><span><span
class="bold"><span class="italic">Figure 8-13.
</span></span></span><span> Standard Olympic plates are the best choice.
They come in a wide variety of denominations and constructions. Metal
plates as light as a quarter-pound are very useful, and bumper plates up
to 25 kg (55 pounds) allow heavy bar loads with fewer plates.
</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Good plates are milled to be close to
the weight named on the casting, and they should be well within a
half-pound, or 0.25 kg. Metric bumper plates go up to 25 kg, and bumper
plates calibrated in pounds are available from a few sources. Bumpers
are useful for power cleans, and save a lot of wear and tear on bars and
platforms. All plates bigger than 25 pounds, and all bumper plates
(since they won’t bump if they don’t touch the floor), should be 17.5
inches (45 cm) in diameter. Good plates should also have a correctly
sized inside diameter (ID) – the size of the hole in the middle where
the bar goes. A sloppy, loose ID in a plate limits its usefulness to
merely hanging from the bar in a rack for a squat, bench, or press. Bad
plates are quite aggravating to use for a deadlift because the slack
between plate and bar sleeve lets the plates lean sideways as they
support the bar on the ground, resulting in the plates continually
“walking” off the bar if it’s uncollared.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Plate racks are available in two main
styles: the A-frame tree and the plate tray. If the A-frame is used, it
should have two pins on each side, spaced so that 45s or other
full-diameter plates can be loaded on the bottom and smaller plates can
be loaded on the top pins. Such a rack can accommodate more than 650
pounds of standard barbell plates. The pins themselves should be made
from at least 8 inches of 1-inch rod, so that the 2-inch hole in the
plate fits over it with an inch of slop. This is very important for ease
of racking the plates – if the pins are made from 2-inch material,
you’ll have to use both hands every time you rack a plate. This can
become annoying. Tray-style racks are easy to use since there is no
center pin, but they usually do not hold as many plates as an A-frame
rack does, and their design is not as sturdy.</span></span></p>

room organization. An A-frame plate rack and two types of tray racks are
available commercially, or can be manufactured by clever, talented
lifters. </span></span></span></p>
<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Collars are usually thought of as
necessary safety equipment in the weight room. Although collars are
important on occasion, it is much more useful to learn to keep the bar
level so that plates don’t slide off it. Plate slide is often a problem
during squats, since walking a bar out of the rack unavoidably involves
some side-to-side movement when you step back. Collars are useful when
you’re squatting, but they are less important when you’re benching and
pressing since the bar theoretically stays level during the movements,
and you take only one step out of the rack for the press. In the event
of an uneven elbow extension, collars are quite handy. If it becomes
apparent that you have problems with uneven extension, it would be
prudent to use collars. It would also be good to correct this error if
possible. Collars are useful in the deadlift, since they help keep
sloppy plates from “walking” down the bar during the pick-up/set-down
cycle. The same holds true for the clean, although bumper plates aren’t
as bad about this as standard plates because they are thicker across the
ID and more plate is in contact with the bar. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Collars come in many designs, from
inexpensive spring clips (which are very serviceable and reliable unless
worn out or sprung), to expensive, very sturdy plastic types, to
set-screw sleeve types, to adjustable competition collars. Collars used
in powerlifting and weightlifting competitions weigh 2.5 kg, while the
other styles will vary quite a bit. Springs work fine for most training
purposes. If security is a problem, two springs can be used on each
side. The weight of the collars will have to be calculated into the load
if precision is necessary.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Chalk, clothing,
training logs, and gym bags</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Chalk should be provided in the weight
room, by either the gym or you. Chalk increases traction between the bar
and the hands, reducing the likelihood of grip accidents. It reduces
callus formation, since the folding of and friction against the skin of
the palms and fingers are functions of the movement of the bar, and
calluses form in response to this stress. It should be kept in a chalk
box in a strategic location in the weight room. If the gym does not
provide the chalk, for whatever misguided reason, you should bring your
own, in a plastic bag or a can that stays in your gym bag. It can be
purchased at most sporting goods stores or ordered over the Internet. If
the gym is nice enough to provide the chalk, be nice enough back to use
it sparingly; don’t bathe in it, don’t drop chunks on the floor, don’t
put clouds of it in the air, or otherwise waste it. Gyms that provide
chalk have decided that training is more important than their
housekeeping concerns, and you should appreciate this
attitude.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Each trainee should have proper
clothing, i.e., a cotton T-shirt, stretchy sweats or shorts, and a pair
of shoes suitable for squatting and pulling. Some facilities provide
belts, but not many, and you’ll probably want your own anyway. One of
the wonderful things about strength training is that minimal personal
equipment is actually necessary, especially compared with other sports.
The money spent on shoes is about the only significant expenditure the
trainee has to make, belts being cheap and quite shareable between
buddies. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Another thing each trainee should have
is a training log – a journal in which to record each workout. No one
can remember all the numbers involved in all the exercises in this
program. Maybe the numbers for a couple of weeks of workouts can be
remembered, but a person’s entire training history constitutes valuable
data that should be recorded for future use. This is information that
will be used each workout and over the course of your training career to
determine the nature of problems and to analyze the productivity of
various training periods. Training information should be written in a
format that can be easily read by both you and any coach you might have,
since you will have to consult your training log on a regular basis. A
composition book works just fine, and the price is certainly right. A
spiral notebook tears up too easily in the gym bag. The best training
book would be a bound ledger, with enough pages for years’ worth of
training notes. </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">All people who are serious about their training write
down their workouts. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Speaking of gym bags, get one, put all
your stuff in it, and keep it with you. That way you’ll always have your
shoes, belt, chalk, training book, Band-Aids, tape, Desenex, spare
shoelaces, extra shirt, towel, knee wraps, straps, and lucky troll doll.
Don’t worry about making a fashion statement with your bag. Just get one
and take it with you every time so that I don’t have to spot you a
towel.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre5"><span class="bold"><span>Soreness and
Injuries</span></span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>There are two more things that everyone
who trains with weights will have: soreness and injuries. They are as
inevitable as the progress they accompany. If you work hard enough to
improve, you will work hard enough to get sore, and eventually you will
work hard enough to get hurt. It is your responsibility to make sure
that you are using proper technique, appropriate progression, and safe
weight room procedures. You will still get hurt, but you will have come
by it honestly – when people lift heavy, they are risking injury. It is
an inherent part of training hard, and it must be prepared for and dealt
with properly when it happens.</span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Soreness is a widely recognized and
studied phenomenon. Despite the fact that humans have experienced muscle
soreness since the Dawn of Time, its cause remains poorly understood. It
is thought to be the result of inflammation in the basic contractile
unit of the muscle fiber, and the fact that it responds well to
anti-inflammatory therapy tends to support this theory. Since muscular
soreness has been experienced by so many people for so long, many
misconceptions about it are bound to develop, and they have. What is
certain is that lactic acid (a transient byproduct of muscle
contraction) has nothing whatsoever to do with it.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Soreness is usually produced when the
body does something to which it is not adapted. A good example of this
would be your first workout if it’s not properly managed. Another
example would be your first workout after a long layoff, which can, if
handled incorrectly, produce some of the most exquisite soreness a human
can experience. Anytime you change a workout program, either by
increasing volume or intensity or by changing exercises, soreness
normally results. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The onset of the perception of soreness
is normally delayed, anywhere from 12 to 48 hours, depending on the age
and conditioning level of the athlete, the nature of the exercise being
done, and the volume and intensity of the exercise. For this reason, it
is referred to in the exercise literature as DOMS, or </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">delayed-onset muscle
soreness</span></span></span><span>. Many people have observed that
certain muscle groups get sore faster and more acutely than others, and
that certain exercises tend to produce soreness, while others, even when
done at a high level of exertion, produce very little.
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The part of the rep that causes most of
the soreness is the eccentric, or “negative,” phase of the contraction,
where the muscle is lengthening under the load rather than shortening.
The eccentric contraction probably causes most of the soreness because
of the way the components of the contractile mechanism in the muscle
fibers are stressed as they stretch apart under a load. And this
explains why some exercises produce more soreness than others. Exercises
without a significant eccentric component, like the power clean, in
which the weight is dropped rather than actively lowered, will not
produce nearly the soreness that the squat will. Squats, benches,
presses, deadlifts, and many assistance and ancillary exercises have
both an eccentric and concentric component, where the muscles involved
both lengthen and shorten under load. Some sports activities, like
cycling, are entirely concentric, since all aspects of pedaling involve
the shortening of the muscles involved. Cycling and exercises like sled
pulling or pushing can therefore be trained very hard without causing
much, if any, soreness. Since soreness is an inflammatory process, the
harder an athlete can train without producing high amounts of muscle
inflammation and the attendant unfriendly hormonal responses, the better
that is for recovery. Exercise methods that produce very high levels of
soreness as a constant feature of the program – due to random exercise
selection that precludes adaptation to the stress – can contribute to
long-term systemic inflammation, the kind that produces poor health
instead of fitness and strength. Soreness is an unavoidable part of
training, but it should not be sought after as a primary objective and
worn as a badge of honor for its own sake.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Occasional acute soreness, unless it is
extreme, is no impediment to training. In fact, many records have been
set by sore athletes. If you are not training hard enough to produce
occasional soreness, and are therefore not having to train while sore,
you are not training very hard. Waiting until soreness subsides before
doing the next workout is a good way to guarantee that soreness will be
produced every time, since you’ll never get adapted to sufficient
workload frequency to stop getting sore. Extreme soreness that
interferes with the normal range of motion must be dealt with on a
case-by-case basis, and you will need to decide whether to train through
the soreness after you have warmed up carefully and thoroughly. But in
general, if the warm-up returns the movement to the normal range of
motion, you can do the workout. Some alterations in programming and
recovery strategies might have to be made if it is determined that the
soreness is the result of an accumulated lack of recovery from the
preceding several workouts. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>In contrast to normal soreness, which by
its nature is delayed for several hours after the workout, an
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">injury</span></span></span><span> can be defined as
something that happens to the body that causes pain in a way that is not
the normal consequence of a correctly performed exercise. An
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="italic">acute
injury</span></span></span><span> is immediately perceived as pain or
discomfort in an identifiable structure and persists after the movement
has stopped. The injury could be a disruption of the structure of a
muscle belly, tendon, or ligament, or, less commonly, of an
intervertebral disc, a knee meniscus, or an articular cartilage. Most
training-associated injuries affect the soft tissues; bony fractures are
extremely rare weight room events. If pain occurs immediately in
response to a movement done during training, it should be assumed to be
an injury and should be treated as such. </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">Chronic
injury</span></span></span><span> is usually an inflammatory response to
the overuse of a joint or its associated connective issue due to poor
technique or excessive training volume. Tendinitis and bursitis are
common diagnoses and are usually the result of repeated exposures to
maladaptive stress. It is extremely important to develop the ability to
distinguish between injury pain and normal soreness, since your health
and long-term progress depend on it.</span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>When you return to training after some
time off, you must consider your de-trained condition. Depending on the
duration of the layoff, different approaches are taken. If you have
missed just a few workouts (fewer than five or six), repeat the last
workout you did before the layoff. You should be able to do this,
although it may be hard. This approach results in less progress lost
than if significant backing-off is done, and the following workout can
usually be done in the order it would have been had the layoff not
occurred.</span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>If the layoff has been a long one, a
couple of months or more, take care when planning your first workout
back. If you have been training with weights for long enough to get very
strong, adaptations have occurred in more than just your muscles. The
neuromuscular system – the nervous system and its interface with the
muscles – has adapted to training by becoming able to recruit motor
units more efficiently, and it is slower to detrain than are the muscles
it innervates. It remembers how to lift heavy weights even if the
muscles are out of shape. This neuromuscular efficiency is quite useful
when you are in shape, but when you are de-trained, it allows you to
lift more than you are actually in condition to do without incurring
adverse effects. Spectacular soreness, as mentioned earlier, will always
be the result unless you use restraint in determining your volume and
intensity. Hubris, not heroism, is demonstrated when a guy comes back
after a year’s layoff and tries to repeat his PRs that day. Unless you
have absolutely nothing else important to do for several days afterward,
please exercise good judgment when doing your first workout back in the
gym. </span></span></p>

<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>A whole lot of people are under the
erroneous impression that weight training is harmful for younger
athletes, specifically the pre-pubescent population. Pediatricians are a
wonderful group of folks as a whole, but very often they are woefully
uninformed regarding the data pertaining to the injury rates of various
sports activities. They may also be reluctant to apply some basic logic
to an analysis of those numbers.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span><a
href="#CR!VBSBJFAP3X66VAADQWQPSTRYQHC1_split_012.html#filepos1215658"
class="calibre9">Table 8-2</a> lists the injury rates of various sports.
Note that organized weightlifting activities, at 0.0012 injuries per 100
participation hours, is about 5100 times safer than everyone’s favorite
organized children’s sport, soccer, at 6.2 injuries per 100 player
hours. Gym class, at 0.18, is more dangerous than supervised weight
training. Yet it is still common for medical professionals to advise
against weight training for kids. The most cursory glance at the actual
data renders this recommendation foolishness. </span></span></p>

Injury rates per 100 participation hours in various sports. From Hamill,

<br />
<br />

<p><span class="calibre7"><span>So why does this mythology persist, and
how did it get started? Most often cited as the primary concern is the
chance of epiphyseal fracture that damages the growth plate, leading to
growth asymmetry in the affected appendage. The entire body of the
sports medicine literature contains six reports of growth-plate
fractures that occurred in kids and were associated with weight
training; none of these reports were detailed enough to determine
whether the injury occurred under the bar (or if there even
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">was</span></span></span><span> a bar), occurred as the
result of a fall due to faulty technique or improper instruction, or
occurred as the result of injudicious loading. And even in these six
isolated examples, none of the kids subsequently displayed
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">any</span></span></span><span> long-term effects that
would indicate that a growth-plate injury does not heal just like any
other injury. You know this yourself because fractures involving joints
are common in kids, and the world is not crawling with roving gangs of
asymmetrically-armed or -legged people seeking revenge for their
misfortune. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>The most intensely silly argument of all
is that weight training stunts a kid’s growth. </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span class="italic">But hauling hay does
not?</span></span></span><span> Such nonsense is not really worthy of
response. Not only does weight training at a young age
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">not</span></span></span><span> harm developing bones and
joints, but it produces thicker, more durable articular cartilage
surfaces that persist into adulthood, and likely contributes to
long-term joint health. The mechanical and biological conditions
produced by full-ROM barbell training affect the skeletal components of
both adults and children in a positive way (Carter, Dennis R. and Gary
S. Beaupré, </span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">Skeletal Function and Form</span></span></span><span>,
Cambridge University Press, 2001).</span></span></p>
<div class="calibre11">
 
</div>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Here’s the bottom line: weight training
is precisely scalable to the age and ability of the individual lifter.
Soccer is not. We have 11-pound bars – or even broomsticks – for kids to
start lifting with, but a full-speed collision on the field with another
80-pound kid is an inherently unscalable event. This logic also applies
to every group of people who might be viewed as a “special population” –
the frail elderly, people with skeletal and muscular disease, the
completely sedentary, the morbidly obese, distance runners, and the
lazy. Note that women are not listed as a special population: they are
</span><span><span class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">half</span></span></span><span> of the population. Anyone
who claims that women are so different in their physiological response
to exercise that the principles of basic barbell training do not apply
to them is thinking either irrationally or commercially. In fact, the
adaptation to weight training is </span><span><span
class="calibre12"><span
class="italic">precisely</span></span></span><span> the adaptation that
these special populations need, and aerobic-type long slow distance
exercise is only a tiny bit more useful than playing
chess.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="calibre7"><span>Blind obedience to the uninformed and
obviously incorrect opinion of a professional who should know better
represents lost opportunity and wasted time and money. For lots of
marginally gifted kids, weight training is often the difference between
a scholarship opportunity and a prohibitively expensive advanced
education. Many people who could have benefited from improved strength,
power, bone density, balance, coordination, flexibility, and confidence
have instead done what they were told and have not benefited at all. Not
all expensive advice is worth the money.</span></span></p>
